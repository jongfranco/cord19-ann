In addition to these evolutionarily convergent coronavirus strains, intriguingly, we found the evidence of evolutionary convergence of the spike protein between the ancestral branch leading to SARS-related CoV and the ancestral branch of COVID-19-related CoV and its sister strains (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21), which harbored 9 evolutionary convergent amino acid sites
The effective reproductive number, R, of COVID-19 in Hubei was in a range of 2.1 to 4.2 in scenarios based on different assumptions and data sources
Different with heart failure, COVID-19 was characterized by an inflammatory pulmonary edema and alveolar damage
