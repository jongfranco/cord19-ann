In the cold season, the cumulative relative risk of non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular death increased at high DTR values in Tabriz
In contrast, many cells in the first cell cycle entered S phase with low amounts of loaded MCM
In crystal structure of ZIKV NS3 helicase with bound ATP, these residues have significant functions such as: the Mn 2+ coordination with GLU 286 stabilizes the ATP molecule; the P-loop residues (GLY 197, ARG 202, LYS 200) and motif VI residues (ARG 459, ARG 462) are playing key role ion NTP hydrolysis by interacting with transition state nucleotides
The increased lung macrophage population was present in severe COVID-19 patients
Firstly, COVID-19 has a relatively long incubation period, which causes a time delay between real dynamic and the dailyobserved case numbers
