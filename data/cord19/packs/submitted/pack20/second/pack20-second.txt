Further comparative alignment analysis on GZ02 (SARS viral strain), Wuhan-Hu-1 (the earliest sequenced SARS-CoV-2), RaTG13, HKU9-1 (the potential ancestor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-1 and OC43) showed that FCS exhibited a clear sequence and rule in coronavirus evolution
The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date.
McLaellen and colleges showed that ACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein with much higher affinity than 76 to SARS-CoV S protein
SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious
We demonstrated that Cas13d-based genetic targeting can effectively target and cleave the RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 fragments and IAV in lung epithelial cell cultures
