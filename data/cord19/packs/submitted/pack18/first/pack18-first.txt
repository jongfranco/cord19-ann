In contrast, higher distributions of CVL218 in tissues especially in lung rather than plasma compared to those of arbidol indicated a superior pharmacokinetic profile of CVL218, which may render it as a better potential antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung
These results show that blocking CD147 on the host cells has an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an essential role of CD147 in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 invasion for host cells
Therefore, we believed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the urinary system, hematological system and digestive system other than the respiratory system, not always with relative symptoms
It is noteworthy that although a strong salt-bridge presented between R426 of SARS-CoV RBD and E329 of ACE2, is missing in the interaction involving SARS-CoV-2 RBD
In conclusion, the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 and other coronavirus disease may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP
