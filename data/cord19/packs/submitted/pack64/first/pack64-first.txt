In conclusion, the use of available information related to SARS-CoV epitopes in conjunction with bionformatic predictions points to specific regions of 2019-nCoV which have a high likelihood of being recognized by human immune responses
The virus is sufficiently genetically similar to the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus that it is reasonable to expect some aspects of epidemiology to be similar, and then update these views as new data emerge
Analysis of allele 60 effects revealed that the founder PWK/PhJ was the main driver of low SARS-CoV titer in the lung
Superposition of the elongation complexes of poliovirus 23 and norovirus 24 onto the SARS-CoV NSP12 reveals the path of the RNA past the active site and indicates amino acids involved in binding or catalysis
SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) formation has been reported to depend upon either M and E proteins or M and N proteins
