These new cases were less likely to attend gatherings with the awareness of the risk of COVID-19 and were soon identified, following the implementation of disease control actions
To investigate the dynamics of COVID-19 binding compared to SARS-2002, we calculate the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of each residue with respect to the lowest energy snapshot from their respective 100ns MD simulation trajectory
The rates of co-infection, including other viruses, bacteria and fungus, were significantly increased in severe patients with COVID-19 than those in non-severe patients
The trained DeCoV-Net took the preprocessed CT-Mask volume of each patient and output the COVID-positive probability as well as COVID-negative probability
The novel coronavirus is believed to be infectious during incubation period when no symptoms are shown on the patients [4] , an important characteristics differentiating COVID-19 from its close relative SARS
