We believe that a similar immune-regulating role of DHODHi will exist in COVID-19 patients
The vast majority of COVID-19 genomic data available at the time of writing are partially or fully assembled genomes
In locations at an early stage of COVID-19, where resources allow investment in high-quality implementation of interventions based on contact tracing, the effectiveness of individual quarantine or active monitoring depends heavily on i) aspects of the disease, especially the assumed serial interval and timing of presymptomatic transmission, and ii) aspects of the setting including the fraction of contacts traced
As showed in Table 1 and Figure 1A , the fatality of all confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients was 5.2%, while fatality of confirmed cases was 5.7%
These implied that the imperfect antivirus therapy probably was responsible for the recurrence of COVID-19 virus
