We speculated that if any common respiratory pathogen, such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses, RSV, ADV, MP and CP, or the previous emerging novel coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was isolated from body fluids and secretions of the infected patients, related treatment and management could have been implemented in the first place
In the S protein of the SARS-CoV, a small domain containing residues 306-575 was identified to be the receptor binding domain (RBD), in which residues 424-494 known as the receptor binding motif (RBM) directly mediate the interaction with ACE2
Phylogenetic studies have shown that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, but they are distantly related 5-8 , with a sequence identity of 79.6% at the whole-genome level 5
However, SARS-CoV, using the same receptor, was not detected in skeletal muscle by post-mortem examination
In conclusion, SARS-Cov is the closest related virus to 2019-nCoV for which a significant number of epitopes has been defined in humans (and other species), and that also causes human disease with lethal outcomes
