Moreover, as the SARS-CoV-2 was supposed to be originated from Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the increased synonymous substitution between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strain suggested the SARS-CoV-2 genome was under stronger negative (purifying) selection
Through comprehensive comparative analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we found the synonymous mutations is dramatically elevated between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 than that of other coronavirus strains, and the nucleotide mutations were enriched in T:C transition
CD147 is closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 invasion for host cells, and SP binds to cellular receptors to mediate infection of host cells, leading to the question whether there is some author/funder
On the other hand, it seems that the interaction with pig 146 ACE2 is more favorable for SARS-CoV-2 isolate since the estimated Kd is 147 3 folds lesser compared to SARS-CoV-2.
The binding surface of olaparib on SARS-CoV-2-N-NTD is similar but not exactly the same to that of CVL218.
