Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, a high viral load and overexuberant host immune response involving innate and acquired immunity, simultaneously contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and organ injury
First, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically close to that of SARS-CoV, with about 79% of sequence identity, and the M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and E (envelope) proteins of these two coronaviruses have over 90% sequence similarities
Our analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition was more sensitive to crRNA concentration in our samples, while lower Cas13d expression only moderately decreased inhibitory activity
Receptor-dependent viral entry is the first step of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The potential existence of non-neutralizing protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 148 highlights the need for an effective SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, which has yet 149 to be established
