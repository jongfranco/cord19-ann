However, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurological manifestations.
Currently, there are data suggesting that there may be super-transmission events in COVID-19 transmission, and the entire range of interpersonal transmission capabilities of COVID-19 remains unknown
Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-20 PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively
We also estimate reasonably high rates of overdispersion in the number of cases each individual causes, leaving open the possibility that large COVID-19 clusters occur even if surveillance and isolation are forcing R below one; events that could potentially overwhelm the surveillance system
The SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models are suitable for modeling COVID-10 epidemics
