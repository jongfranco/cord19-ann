Our observation of glycan and fatty acid ligands in S1-S2 interfaces suggests a role for these ligands in modulating these interfaces and we hypothesize that these glycan and fatty acid interactions serve to stabilize the viral spike
Previous studies 75 from our group have demonstrated that rhinovirus (RV) species C is the most frequent viral pathogen detected in children who present to the local emergency department (ED) with an 77 asthma exacerbation
Similar to what have been reported with nanoparticles, we found that RSV accelerated the kinetics of amyloid aggregation of a model amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP (NNFGAIL)
There is accumulating evidence on the existence of many asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases
The function(s) of the proteins encoded by both U1 and U2 remain to be elucidated
