All these data indicated that COVID-19 could cause multiple organic injury
COVID-19 spreads from human to human, therefore in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance and quarantine policies, faster detection of infected cases should reduce further growth
A positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for 309 COVID-19 in these patients suggests that they do have the potential to infect others
Therefore, in the treatment of COVID-19, early prevention of kidney impairment, including adequate hemodynamic support and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, is particularly important and early renal replacement treatment may improve the patients' prognosis
Taken together, we conclude that T cells are decreased and exhausted in patients with COVID-19.
