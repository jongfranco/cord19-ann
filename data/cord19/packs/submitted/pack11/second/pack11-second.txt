High mutation rate, human to human transmission, survival time of up to 4 days under various environmental conditions and lack of treatment makes it a potential bioterrorism agent
A seasonality factor of 0.5 indicates that the amplitude of seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2 is half the amplitude of the seasonal variation in R0 for the other betacoronaviruses
Tremendous efforts have been made from around the world to provide a fast and reliable diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2
Notably, the dN/dS ratio of RBD region in SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 was dramatically increased in about 3 fold in comparison with full spike region
In addition, six critical key residues in MERS-CoV RBD binding to its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) are all different in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus
