CA12 has been linked to drug resistance in multiple cancer types (Boyd et al., 2017; Doyen et al., 2013; Kopecka et al., 2016) and we have previously demonstrated that it is overexpressed in FLC (Dinh et al., 2017)
Infected cell foci were detected 42-108 46 hpi
Some patients also received glucocorticoid and/or intravenous immunoglobulin administration
In summary, our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality, China
Moreover, considering that about 9% of all infected individuals are ascertained and reported, the infection fatality risk (IFR), i.e., the risk of death among all infected individuals, would be on the order of 0.5% to 0.8%.
