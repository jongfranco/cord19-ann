Furthermore, in transplant patients, concern for GVHD may compel clinicians to initiate empiric immunosuppressive agents that could inadvertently exacerbate disease in the presence of an unrecognized infection
By capturing both microbial and human RNA, mNGS also permits simultaneous transcriptional profiling of the host immunologic response, which can provide complementary insight regarding the presence and type of infection
In some situations, empiric regimens may lack activity against an underlying microbe, leading to treatment failure, disease progression, and consequent adverse outcomes
In this proof of concept study, we demonstrate that mNGS can simultaneously detect pathogens and the host response in HCT patients with acute respiratory illnesses
Of note, liver damage is emerging as a co-existed symptom reported in patients with COVID-19
