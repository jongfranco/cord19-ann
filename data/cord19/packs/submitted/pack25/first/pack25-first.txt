Nsp8 proteins is predicted to have a long disorder segment from 44-84 residues in both SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS and 48-84 residues in Bat CoV
Our analysis revealed the intrinsic disorder in M proteins of SARS-COV-2 Human SARS, and Bat CoV as estimated mean PPID is 2.70%, 1.36%, and 1.36% respectively.
Considering that the development of a new drug generally takes years, probably the best therapeutic shortcut is to apply the drug repositioning strategy (i.e., finding the new uses of old drugs) to identify the potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 of existing drugs that have been approved for clinical use or to enter clinical trials.
Thus, SARS-COV-2 infection may not be the major reason related to liver injury
Positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples detected by RT-PCR; Virus sequence detected in respiratory or blood samples shares high homology with the known sequence of SARS-CoV-2
