Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a leading reason for hospitalization and mortality in hematopoietic cellular transplant (HCT) recipients
Diagnosis of LRTI in HCT recipients is particularly challenging due to high rates of noninfectious inflammatory conditions such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) that can drive pulmonary inflammation, induce fever and mimic infection
Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) inherently offers enhanced diagnostic capabilities by providing a culture-independent, comprehensive measurement of the microbial composition of clinical samples
This technology permits the simultaneous detection of bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens without introducing bias associated with fixed-target PCR or serologic
However, a proportion of patients showed multi-organ damage and dysfunction
