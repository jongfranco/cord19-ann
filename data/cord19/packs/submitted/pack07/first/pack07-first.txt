We created a NOT gate by using a P-type transistor comprising ampicillin-loaded heat-triggered liposomes, which caused bacteria to die at high temperatures (i.e., IN = 1) and survive at low temperatures (i.e., IN = 0)
Again, SENSR successfully detected its target RNA as low as 0.1 aM, which corroborates the 205 high adaptability of this method to various RNA markers
Carriage is a dynamic process involving fluctuations of species and strains
Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element
Full-length amphiphysin produces highly curved fission products
