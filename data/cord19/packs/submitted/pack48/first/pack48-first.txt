Based on the above research evidence, we have reason to speculate that families of HCWs may also suffer from similar psychological problems to HCWs during COVID-19 epidemic
Over 78% of the HCWs exhibited a positive perception of COVID-19
We find that the stringent quarantine and public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the transmission rate of COVID-19
Comorbidities have been reported to be associated with severity of COVID-19 infection
Obviously, more patients had cardiovascular disease in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group
