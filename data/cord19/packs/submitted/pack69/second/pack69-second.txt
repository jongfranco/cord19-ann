The CoViD-19 outbreak has become increasingly severe, and no drugs so far have proved capable of stemming the viral growth
Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter
If asymptomatic infections are more persistent than symptomatic ones, the mean generation interval for COVID-19 could be longer than estimated from symptomatic cases alone
The protection, maintenance or promotion of lymphocyte levels might have a good effect on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19
Therefore, temperature screening in the high-risk 56 population is important for early identification of COVID-19 infection and thereby reducing the risk of cross infection
