Taken together with our receptor assay results, it may be possible that 2019-nCoV arose from recombination between clade 1 and the other clades
A similar principle of antagonistic contraction along perpendicularly oriented families of fibers is at work at the sub-cellualr level, for example in the antagonistic motor protein dynamics in contractile ring structures important in cell division and development
In contrast, concentrated sugar is relative rare in wild niches and competition for it is fierce, with concentrations unlikely to often exceed the 0.5% threshold at which sugar fermentation kicks in
Killer toxin encoded by pGKL plasmids is translated by the cap-independent pathway
Comparing with SARS-CoV and MERS, 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple countries and regions and leading to the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
