Previous study demonstrated that the main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, and is considered to be an attractive target for drug development
MERS-CoV, along with Murine hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV, belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus
The stoichiometry of the Ca 2+ to the MERS-CoV FP is significantly different from that for the FP1_2 of SARS-CoV FP (n=1.7) and similar to FP1 or FP2 of the SARS-CoV FP (n=0.92 and 1.02, respectively)
Although the early cases indicate the illness is less severe than other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the evidences of rapid human-tohuman transmission indicates that 2019-nCoV is more contagious than others
However, in the SARS-CoV infected cells, the ACE2 was significantly correlated with neutrophils, NK cells, Th17 cells, Th2 cells, Th1 cells, DC
