The off-diagonal numbers are genes that have differential expression in two viruses 560 compared to mock and the third virus, but are not significantly different from each other
Although sample availability was not a limiting factor for these two specimens, both proved reluctant to spread over the holes of cryoEM grids
The killer virus is a satellite RNA of L-A and is totally dependent on 231 L-A proteins for replication
A short homopolymeric stretch of 5' adenosine nucleotides thus might destabilize eIF4E binding to the mRNA cap
Although the overall mechanism involved in improved sensitivity and efficiency due to the use of flap primers in TaqMan qPCR assays is still not completely clear, a study conducted by Vandenbussche and group suggests that tailed primers suppress the formation of PCR artifacts, determined by primers and dNTP type
