Also, most of the cases published until now tends to use nasopharyngeal swab specimens for nucleic acid tests
In positive-strand RNA virus polymerases, the index finger loop reaches over the active site to contact the thumb domain, positioning the ring-finger loop beneath it
A constant-strength intervention reduces the density by a constant proportion: K(τ) = K(τ)/θ; when the strength of intervention matches the strength of epidemic (θ = R), the resulting distribution is equivalent to the intrinsic generation-interval distribution (K(τ) = g(τ))
The experimental results showed that the expression level of U1 snRNA 294 decreased after 4X, 9X and 6X dosage (Materials and Methods) in the HEK293 (human), SY5Y (human) 295 and PC-12 (rat) cell lines, respectively
The dynamics of the full system differ from those of the two-dimensional mean-field ODE as expected from the transitions from coexistence (during the VDR) and the host dominance at carrying capacity (during the HCR)
