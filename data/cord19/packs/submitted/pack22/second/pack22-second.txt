These results confirm the interaction of CD147 and SP, indicating a novel potential route for SARS-CoV-2 to invade host cells
Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are a high-risk group highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 due to underlying disease and poor immunity
In this work, we developed a Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells (PAC-MAN) strategy as a form of genetic intervention to target SARS-CoV-2, IAV, and potentially all sequenced coronaviruses
SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein with a mean PPID of 10.31% has a N-terminal (1-10 residues) predicted disordered segment
The majority (65.4%) of the reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that viral 112 transcripts dominate the transcriptome while the host gene expression is strongly suppressed
