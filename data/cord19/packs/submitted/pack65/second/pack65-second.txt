A previous attempt to predict drugs for the M pro of SARS-CoV has identified two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, namely lopinavir and ritonavir, as potential candidates, both of which bind to the same target site of M pro
Additionally, the available experimental data of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors can be used as the training set to generate new inhibitors of 2019-nCoV protease
Using the same mathematical model described above, we estimated that our specific SARS-CoV-2-designed panel can detect 1.15 copies of the virus at 95% probability
On the other hand, our results show that the binding energy and the interface sequence of SARS-CoV-2 234 RBD are closer to SARS-CoV related isolates (either from Human or other 235 species).
In SARS-CoV, K929 in HR1 binds to E1163 in HR2 through a salt bridge 214 3.2 Ã… in distance, while T925 is not involved in the interaction
