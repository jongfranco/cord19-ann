MSA results demonstrate that, ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 is not closer to ORF3b protein of Human SARS and to ORF3b protein of Bat-CoV, having a sequence similarity of only 54.55% and 59.09% respectively
The main manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, dry cough, weakness, and breathing difficulty
SARS-CoV-2 assays can yield false positives if they are not targeted specifically to SARS-CoV-2, as the virus is closely related to other Coronavirus organisms
The presence of asymptomatic infection also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza, or it may be latent in humans for a long time
Therefore, our results suggested that the monkeys with SARS-CoV-2 infection after recovery could not be re-infected with the same strain
