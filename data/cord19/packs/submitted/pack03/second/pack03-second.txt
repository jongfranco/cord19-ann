Previously, microarray approaches proved useful for broadening the scope of pathogens detectable in a single LRTI assay
ACE2+ cholangiocytes are preserved in human liver ductal organoid cultures
Some microarrays have even incorporated conserved sequences from all known viruses, allowing detection of novel viral strains
Our results suggest that simultaneous mNGS detection of respiratory pathogens, the host's immunologic response and the airway microbiome may provide complementary data that could inform the clinical significance of a detected pathogen
The dominant symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are fever and cough
