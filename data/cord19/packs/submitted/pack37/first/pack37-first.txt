In summary, the yeast linear pGKL plasmids represent a model and the most studied example of a unique world of the yeast cytoplasmically localized linear double-stranded DNA plasmids
PARP2 maintains genomic stability by recruiting DNA repair machinery to sites of DNA damage, and when not required is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome
We evaluated different solutions to solve these problems and observed that splitting of the original virus genome sequence in combination with merging the prediction results of the generated subsequences leads to fast and efficient learning on long sequences
On average, the NP-exo WT and NP-exo mutant viruses respectively presented one infectious particle for 3600 and 23000 NP RNA copies, respectively
