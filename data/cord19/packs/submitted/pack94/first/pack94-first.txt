Over half (n=30, 56.6%) of the COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated cardiac marker levels
In addition to the diagnosis value of Ab test, our study revealed a strong positive correlation between clinical severity and antibody titer since 2-week after illness onset, for the first time in COVID-19 patients
In this study, the median age of 116 COVID-19-confirmed patients was 54 years (IQR, 38-69; range 20-95 years), of which 67 (57.8%) were male
None of our cases had severe respiratory illness requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, suggesting it will be rare that patients meeting the definition of a suspected case will require enhanced care, at least while COVID-19 itself remains rare in the UK
Similar to the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS, severity of COVID-19 disease is associated with increased age and/or a comorbidity, although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups
