One of these conformations is highly similar to the ligand bound form of the RBD, while the second conformation would clash with the ACE2 receptor
A recent approach combines mutagenesis by PCR with degenerate (NNK) primers with in-cell recombination to create variation at specific residues in the tail fiber of T3 phage
Nucleotide sequence preference improve siRNA silencing efficiency as bases at particular positions define target recognition and cleavage
Domestication impairing yeast sporulation represents a truly seismic change to the biology of the organism
This is likely thanks to these strains retaining, or having re-acquired, a life cycle closer to that of wild yeast
