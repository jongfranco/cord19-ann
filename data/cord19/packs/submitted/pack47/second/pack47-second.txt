Other infections may therefore exacerbate COVID-19
A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts
Moreover, the pathological features of COVID-19 pneumonia greatly resemble those seen in SARS and MERS, and show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia
Consistent with previous reports, older patients (â‰¥65 years old), were more likely to have a severe type of COVID-19 in the case series patients in the present study
