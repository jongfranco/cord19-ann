Thus, the C-terminal domain of XP is involved in membrane permeabilization and harbours key features of a viroporin
However, the N-terminal regions of S proteins display noteworthy differences
In addition to EVC and EVC2, we identified two paralogs, EVC3.1 and EVC3.2 323 , in the choanoflagellate, sea anenome and sea urchin ciliomes
Particularly, the influenza data seems considerably more affected by the smaller look-back windows
SMM algorithm of MHC-1 binding, transporter of antigenic peptides (TAP) transport efficiency and proteasomal cleavage efficiency are also considered to determine the IC 50 values for processing prediction of epitopes by MHC-I molecules
