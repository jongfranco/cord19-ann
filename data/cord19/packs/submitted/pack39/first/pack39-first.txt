Here, network proximity analysis shows a significant association between Irbesartan's targets and HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome
The mechanisms underlying virus-induced exacerbations in COPD and the factors that drive inflammation and clinical severity during these episodes are poorly understood
By comparing these two values, we found that 2019-nCoV S-RBD reaches about 73% of the binding strength of SARS-CoV S-RBD to ACE2
We hypothesized that carriers of this SNP may have reduced TLR4-mediated inflammation.
We note that the network based models are computationally inefficient while those using metapopulations, although efficient, usually fail to maintain initial populations of patches
