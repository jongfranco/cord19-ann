Our previous researches show that CD147 plays a functional role in facilitating SARS-CoV invasion for host cells, and CD147-antagonistic peptide-9 has a high binding rate to HEK293 cells and an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV
Since the 2019-nCoV genome exhibits substantial similarity to the 2002 SARS-CoV genome and proteome , we hypothesize that many of the interactions observed in the SARS proteome are expected to be preserved in the 2019-nCoV proteome as well, unless the corresponding binding sites were affected
It was reported that convalescent plasma treatment reduced the hospital stay and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV infection and severe influenza A (H1N1)
In our 2019-nCoV 3D model, we found that 2019-nCoV was highly similar to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) domain of SARS-CoV
The amino acid homology between the modeled proteins and SARS-CoV S is noted in red and amino acid differences in blue in both models and identity scale
