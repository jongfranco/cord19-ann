It induces autophagy by activating the omegasome pathway which is normally implied by cells in response to starvation
CTD interacts with itself (lane 3), agreeing with published crystal structure and acting as a positive control in this binding assay
Note no GFP-MAD2 L13A is localized at metaphase kinetochores containing mCherry-Mis12-MAD1 AA , although GFP-MAD2 L13A does appear at the last few unattached kinetochores most likely due to presence of endogenous MAD1 there
The situation is different for Pyrococcus: Native Nanopore data suggest that the rRNA is heavily modified
The results showed that LPS treatment increased LC3B-II and ATG5 in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with the results that LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokines release in a dose-dependent manner
