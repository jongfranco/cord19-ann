Moreover, we observed an apparently accelerated evolution of RBD of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV related to their phylogenetic intermediates
This is critical since COVID-19 infection can rapidly progress from hospital admission to ARDS in as few as 2 days, and COVID-19 infection can be fatal
As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced "cytokine storms" that was fatal
This delay reflects the potentially long time from infection to severe and critical conditions as many COVID-19 patients who eventually require ICU care present initially as having only mild symptoms, and even longer time to discharge or death, resulting in the accumulation of hospitalized cases long after the downturns in the community spread.
Consistent with this report, we here also found that the secretion of cytokines including TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-10 was increased in COVID-19 patients
