The confirmation delay does not affect the infecting process, but brings a direct hinder in inspecting the real number of confirmed cases
MSIR model predicts a earlier and higher infectious peak position than MSEIR model
Consistent with a role of DUSP1 in the dephosphorylation of JNK and p38, we observed a marked increase of JNK and p38 phosphorylation in the absence of DUSP1 during SeV and RSV infection
Phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer events are responsible for the spread of novel functions including the development of pathogenicity in bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pyogenes and many Staphylococcus aureus strains
The sequence identity between the 3CL proteases of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV is 96.08%
