Consistent with the first mode, we observed the activation of the genes EDS1 and PAD4, components of R genemediated disease resistance with homology to lipases, in every infection studied in this work
Whereas the structural 506 proteins that make up cilia are conserved among most ciliated Eukaryotes, including humans, 507 few metazoan signaling proteins are conserved outside of the animal kingdom
The number of substitutions, thus potential for reduction in host-specific fitness, increases with genome size
The heat map patterns ( Figure 1C ) and even more the corresponding composite plots for the Reb1bound genes only ( Figure 1D ) suggested that the distance of arrays to the barrier Reb1 as well as the linker lengths varied with nucleosome density in a remodeler-specific way
DBP is a multifunctional protein that, in addition to vitamin D, binds actin, acting as an actin scavenger, and also binds fatty acids
