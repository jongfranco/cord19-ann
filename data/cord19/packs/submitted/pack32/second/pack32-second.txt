Interestingly, in contrast to stem cells from other mammalian species, bat RSCs 27 are capable of both responding to and producing IFN-I, and present a unique interferon-stimulated 28 gene (ISG) transcriptomic signature, suggesting some fundamental differences between bats and 29 other mammals
However KNTC1-null RPE cells exhibited severe SAC failure when kinetochore attachments were ablated with nocodazole or when STLC or taxol were used to induce erroneous attachments
In our sample period, higher wind speeds or more precipitation decrease the number of infections in the future
The presence of replicative forms (anti-sense viral genome) suggests an intracellular origin of the viral RNA and its secretion into the jelly rather than RNA derived exclusively from environmental capsids
The simulated experiments suggested that genome length and read length influence VI
