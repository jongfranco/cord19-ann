In total, RNAseq identified 10 RNA viruses, all of which have established pathogenicity in the lungs, and the RNA intermediates of five DNA viruses that have uncertain pulmonary pathogenicity
DNAseq identified the genomes of these same five DNA viruses as well as five others including CMV and HHV-6, which have been associated with pneumonitis
We found significantly increased expression in patients with confirmed LRTI pathogens versus those without
When benchmarked against the conventional standard of care testing performed during the time of study enrollment, mNGS demonstrated 100% sensitivity for microbial detection and permitted identification of potential new viral and bacterial pathogens in six of 15 (40%) subjects with otherwise negative testing.
We observed that the presence of respiratory pathogens was characterized by increased expression of host immune response genes and lower airway microbial diversity.
