The mean PPID score of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV is calculated to be 1.41%, 1.12%, and 1.85% respectively.
As we enter a period of generalized circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, surveillance based on clinical description and swabbing by GPs will prove essential to help us assess the situation
Hence these SARS-CoV-2 proteins are expected to act in the same way as they do in other SARS, namely as accessory proteins mostly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, but also occurring on the cell membrane where they enhance viral pathogenicity and mortality through protein-protein interactions
In conclusion, due to its simplicity, robustness, and excellent performances, our pcMNPs-based method may provide a promising alternative to solve the laborious and time-consuming viral RNA extraction operations, and thus exhibits a great potential in the high throughput SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis
The new viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, leading to exponential rise of new cases and causing tens of thousands of documented cases of COVID-19 disease to date
