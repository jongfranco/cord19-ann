Amongst the cases with negative clinical testing, mNGS identified six patients harboring transcriptionally active microbes with recognized respiratory pathogenicity
With respect to viruses, HCOV-229E was identified in two patients and HRV-A was identified in three patients, one of whom was also culture-positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
Furthermore, mNGS can detect entire viral genomes, as illustrated in Figure E1 , an attribute that can enable genotyping, detection of resistance mutations, and epidemiologic tracking of disease outbreaks (41).
With respect to previously unidentified bacterial pathogens, mNGS detected Streptococcus mitis, an oropharyngeal microbe known to cause bacteremia and acute respiratory distress in HCT recipients, as a potential pulmonary pathogen in one patient
WU polyoma virus was detected by DNA sequencing another case, and while this virus has been associated with respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients, evidence supporting its role as a pathogen is lacking
