It is unlikely that the non-functional MTase region would not be eliminated from plasmids during evolution
Previously, it was suggested that this motif could confer poor substrate properties to the nsp8-9 cleavage site, which would result in a considerable influence on processing order and RTC assembly
This is because the beginning of the true infectious period may occur before the onset of symptoms; however, this is difficult to measure and is not generally reported in the studies that report values for the incubation period
Hence, it is possible that the amino acid similarity between the RBD of the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV is due to selectively-mediated convergent evolution rather than recombination, although it is difficult to choose between these scenarios on current data
We hypothesize that the ability to escape 300 from transcriptional repression is linked to the open conformation of viral DNA in replication 301 compartments, and that this helps these viruses counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss
