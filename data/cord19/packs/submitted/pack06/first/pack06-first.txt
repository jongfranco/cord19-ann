Many pathogenic mutations in the human telomerase RNA are found in the wellconserved PK region of the RNA, further underscoring the importance of the PK
Highly notably, the current confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is entirely based on the viral real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result
While mortality due to PEDV infection is lower in older pigs, infection can still result in decreased growth performance
ACE2 is mainly expressed in AT2 cells and also detected in AT1 cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages
Furthermore, rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals implanted into the brain for four weeks did not cause activation of glial cells beyond that caused by biocompatible optic fibers
