These regions included damage to left hemisphere posterior superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri, angular gyrus and underlying white matter (superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus)
Further, we employed a Taq polymerase PCR stop assay to investigate whether 9-amino acridine complex formation with SE-PGQs, make it possible to stop the movement of polymerase replication machinery or not
The solvated Zika homology NS2B-NS3pro complex was first energy minimized with 1000 steps of steepest descent using GROMACS version 4.5.7 using AMBER all-atom force field
CML is a chronic hematologic tumor, and comprehensive measures should be taken to delay and reduce the risk of infection by restricting patient exposure to situations with possible transmission
The former may be required for the H7N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infections, probably via hemagglutinin-induced lysis, whereas the latter is widely reported to mediate and assist in the invasion of host cells by multiple viruses
