7 mNGS in field settings proved critical in development of countermeasures for the 2014-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, just as ongoing sequencing of COVID-19 cases from lesser developed areas of Southeast Asia will contribute to overall understanding of pathogen transmission, origin, and evolution
Our results show the incubation mean and median of COVID-19 are 5.84 and 5.0 days respectively and there is a statistical significance with the role of gender
X indicates the cases who did not included in this study population but have been confirmed as COVID-19 pneumonia or as virus-carrier
Whereas positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract has been described , these observations do not address principal differences between SARS and COVID-19 in terms of clinical pathology
Among these pathways, the interferon-MAPK signaling pathway was the major blood immune response for COVID-19 infection
