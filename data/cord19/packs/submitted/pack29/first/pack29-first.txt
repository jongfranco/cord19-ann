To investigate the RNA binding property of prepared pxMNPs, RNA binding assays were performed by incubating 2 μg RNA molecules with 20 μg pcMNPs in 200 μL lysis/binding buffer
Analogous to these earlier studies of lineage C CoVs, we observed protease-enhanced entry of lineage B CoVs (figure 2, 3, 5).
Such model outputs have proven useful in identifying areas of risk of transmission of dengue as well as malaria (Gething et al.
Small changes to its structure, including moving the isopropyl ether 172 substituent to the naphthyl ring system (B#59), or the introduction of an additional aromatic ring-173 bound nitrogen atom (B#57), results in drastically reduced antiviral activity
People with mild symptoms unlikely to be diagnosed in a particular time and place (sometimes referred to as subclinical cases) are expected to affect transmission patterns in the same way
