The swine proteins which interacted with the hits were predicted to interact with the ASFV proteins
The perfusion system allowed for fluid exchange and enabled the addition of transfection agents on the stage during the time-lapse measurement
Initially, when the number of cases is relatively low, the only way to reduce the contact rate is the administratively-imposed quarantine
Initiation of replication on the donor followed by a switch to the acceptor at a site after the oriI locus will yield an infectious genome that can be scored by plaque assay
In our analysis, the signaling pathways in C3 were mainly RAS, Vitamin D and RXR activation, and Chemokine signaling, with RAS being the most significant
