Both COVID-19 and SARS-2002 interfaces contain long flexible loops and nine aromatic residues (Tyr, Trp, Phe) in the interface with ACE2
As alluded to before, there are many types of COVID-19 with respect to acuteness of the disease
The energy landscapes of CTT sequences become progressively more rugged (increasing D) with increasing Îº, although the landscapes for variants CTLV1, CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4 retain the width (similar s values) of the WT CTT
Another source of variation is the origins of the interacting proteins
In the crystal packing of the NSP7-NSP8 structure, the authors hypothesized the formation of a hetero-hexadecamer protein complex
