Based on our findings and assuming no drastic change in infection rates (e.g., schools and workplaces remain closed and intercity travel limited), we can conclude, with optimism, that the COVID-19 epidemic would end around April 2020.
Our results thus provide a preliminary demonstration of T cell exhaustion during COVID-19 infection and suggest that more aggressive early intervention may be required in patients with low T lymphocyte counts
The results indicate that the effects of DTR should also be paid attention on the mortality of COVID-19
Importantly, we identified N8R and NLR as powerful prognostic factors for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases
Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC, and the reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25 ≤ R 0 ≤ 3.4 if we simply use R0 = 1 + r * Tc with Tc = 7.5
