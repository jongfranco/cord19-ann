Our previous work demonstrating that monocytes and macrophages can produce pro-inflammatory cytokine during murine hepatitis virus strain-3 infection, and whether SARS-CoV-2 also triggers cytokine release from monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients need further investigation and such work is in progress in our hospital
In addition, considering high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 at early stage after symptom onset, suggested RT-LAMP assays may still be usable for screening tests
Furthermore, we have previously shown that CCoV strain A76 also has a recombinant S 103 protein, a product of recombination between serotype I and II CCoV sequences
SARS-CoV-2 has a disordered segment from 168-289 residues while Human SARS has predicted to have an unstructured segment from 145-289 residues
Such potential evolution direction may promote the appearance of mild subtype of COVID-19.
