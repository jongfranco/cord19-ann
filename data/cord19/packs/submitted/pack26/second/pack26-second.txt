Measurements of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins to recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing 293T cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to human ACE2 (Figure 2A&B) , which provided direct molecular based evidences to support and possibly explain the observation that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has similar transmissibility to SARS-CoV virus
There was an enrichment in glycine (G), serine (S), and in the acidic residues glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) over rounds compared to the original library
Clearly, according to the PCR product intensity, after several passages with Tupanvirus, the amount of mutant Guarani DNA evolved to decrease
Both CTD 4A and CTD 4E showed defects in binding to O-MAD2 and C-MAD2
A number of HLA types and amino acid positions have been demonstrated to be associated to JIA, uveitis and related autoimmune diseases through genome-wide association and candidate gene studies
