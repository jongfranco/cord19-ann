Furthermore, statistical analysis showed that the percentage of PD-1 + CD8 + T cells from ICU patients was significantly higher than from both Non-ICU cases and healthy controls ( Figure 3B) , indicating that SARS-CoV-2 viruses induce T cell exhaustion in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those requiring ICU care
Our results demonstrate the mean PPID of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV to be equal to 1.96%
Currently, the main known transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory air droplets
The comparison of the two batches of samples showed the effectiveness and importance of sanitization in reducing the airborne SARS-CoV-2 in high risk areas
The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak of coronavirus example, the recently solved structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (PDB ID: 6LU7)
