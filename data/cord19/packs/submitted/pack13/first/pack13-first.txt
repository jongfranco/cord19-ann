In the analysis 197 of membrane protein, pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 198 than all the other viruses
The virtual elimination of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 would be possible if SARS-CoV-2 induced 70% cross immunity against them, which is the same estimated level of cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 induces against HCoV-HKU1.
These results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 uses the canonical TRS-mediated 144 mechanism for discontinuous transcription to produce major sgRNAs
Lung injury begins with an insult to the lung epithelium mainly attacked by SARS-CoV-2 itself because of ACE2 expressed in the lungs, which leads to most common respiratory failure
With the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, its amino acid sequence is also significantly varied
