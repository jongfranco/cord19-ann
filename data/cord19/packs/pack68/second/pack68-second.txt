Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
Novel coronaviruses (COVID-19) , which was found in Wuhan, China in December 2019 presents an acute public health threat to the whole world
The prevalence of COVID-19 in cases with CT-confirmed pneumonia sent for 2019-nCoV testing was 23.9% (21/88)
This yields an R0 above 2, comparable to current estimates for COVID-19
Clinical studies conducted on hospitalised cases show that the onset of COVID-19 is associated with symptoms commonly associated with viral pneumonia, most commonly fever, cough/sore throat and myalgia/fatigue
