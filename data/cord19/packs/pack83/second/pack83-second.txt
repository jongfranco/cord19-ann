The high risk factors of cardiac injury including tachycardia, TnI elevation and low EAT density in CT scan, have been observed in the severe and critical COVID-19 patients
We found statistically significant evidence of positive diversifying selection (~7% of S -gene sites) along the branch leading to COVID-19
In addition, another explanation is that some COVID-19 patients may have a past history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD patients have a proinflammatory milieu and functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations
The levels of PCT, a marker suggesting the bacterial infection, were not elevated in the patients with COVID-19, suggesting the viral-mediated pneumonia rather than bacteria
We conclude that a significant reduction of COVID-19 cases is achievable only through a systematic package consisting of enhanced control measures including self-isolation / self-production , effective quarantine and rapid detection / testing
