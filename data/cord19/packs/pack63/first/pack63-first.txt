However, despite the correlations between the two viruses, no RBD-targeted SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies have shown the ability to bind and neutralize 2019-nCoV
It was also shown that the sequence of S-29 protein from SARS-CoV shares more than 70% identity with the S-protein from 2019-30
We have learned from SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov that human populations showed disparities in susceptibility to these viruses
Gemcitabine, which was originally approved for treating certain types of cancers , was also predicted for targeting SARS-CoV with validation by previous in vitro studies
More specifically, the two sites belong to the short helix including changes that were found in human SARS-CoV
