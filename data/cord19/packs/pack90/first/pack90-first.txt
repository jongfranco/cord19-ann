Given the superspreading is unlikely to occur, we can be confident to control the COVID-19 outbreak by reducing the reproduction number to below unity
Furthermore, the disease course of COVID-19, the duration of viral existence, and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers remain unknown

COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors
New genes; ORF8 and ORF6; were found inserted in COVID-19 which were absent in HCov-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission
