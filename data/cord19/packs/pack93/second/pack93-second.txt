The existing spread of COVID-19 is faster than SARS partially because it has more complicate spread dynamics
COVID-19 is apparently more contagious than SARS and, without protection, people can be easily infected by close contact
Interestingly, there were 24 (45%) COVID-19 patients with elevation in the levels of one or more myocardial enzymes and markers of myocardial damage whose features did not meet the strict definition of myocardial injury, with most of them having the common NCP type and experiencing quick recovery; however, 58.33% of these patients exhibited LV dysfunction on echo, and long-term outcomes should be observed via follow-up in a future study
We demonstrate here that COVID-19 patients have very high levels of serum IL-10 following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also displaying high levels of the PD-1 and Tim-3 exhaustion markers on their T cells, suggesting that IL-10 might be mechanistically responsible
By assuming these rates of early epidemic growth, we estimate that 130 cities in China have â‰¥50% chance of having a COVID-19 case imported from Wuhan in the 3 weeks preceding the quarantine
