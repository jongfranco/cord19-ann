SARS-CoV was previously shown to depend on both extracellular and intracellular Ca 2+ pools for successful infection, and it is believed that this dependency is due to Ca 2+ interactions with the SARS-CoV FP
Regarding the respiratory hygiene measures, facemask wearing is considered as one of the most cost-effective and important measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but it became a social concern due to the recent global facemask shortage
Our study also shows that the activation of the interferon-MAPK signaling pathway and TCR-and BCRproduced antibodies play key roles in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection
It is widespread opinion in the scientific community that current official data on the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, responsible of the correlated disease, COIVD-19, among population, are likely to suffer from a strong downward bias
The antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are specific, sensitive, and more importantly, their detection can be much faster and simpler than RT-PCR, which allows rapid screening of suspect cases to be possible
