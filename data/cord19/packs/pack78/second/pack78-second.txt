A good understanding of the epidemic dynamic would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases, while dynamic model is probably one of the oldest and best-known mathematical tools to study the law of epidemic development
Logistic regression analysis indicated that NCP severity was a risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients
Other significant parameters, age and meaningful lower respiratory symptoms, were also included into the COVID-19 EWS
We predict that, in the absence of any interventions, a disease with "best-guess" CoVID-19-like parameters will peak a median of 133 days (range 126 -147 days) following the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales
Similarly, only 12 residues (40%) in SARS-2002 are conserved with respect to COVID-19
