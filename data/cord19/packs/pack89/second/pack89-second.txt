Genetic analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the virus was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
Due to similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS and COVID-19, we hypothesize that in addition to improve the oxygenation of the severe cases, iNO gas retains potent antiviral activity against 2019-nCoV responsible for SARS-CoV-2
Therefore, we speculate that persisting decrease of lymphocytes may be an indicator of severe disease, rather than a criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19
According to all models, temperature increases the doubling time, which means that it delays the spread of COVID-19
Fever is less widespread amongst those infected with COVID-19 than those with SARS-CoV (99%) and MERS-CoV (98%)
