Sequence analysis of polymerase subunits across the Nidovirales order, which includes coronaviruses, revealed three conserved sequence motifs within this region: AN (SARS-CoV a.a. 69-89), BN (a.a. 112-130), and CN (a.a. 202-222)
The resulting thiohemiketal is in the R configuration in the SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 M pro but in the S configuration in the CVB3 3C pro complex
However, the roles of T cells, especially resident T cells, in controlling the disease severity of SARS-CoV infected patients are not proved yet
ACE2 is previously known as the receptor for SARS-Cov and NL63
Based on bioinformatics analyses, it has been shown that 2019-nCoV genome is 88% identical with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21), 79% with SARS-CoV, and 50% with MERS
