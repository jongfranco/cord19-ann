Our study discovered that, in low epidemic regions outside Hubei province such as Eastern-China region, the current reliable first approach to the unexplained pneumonia should be a combination of chest CT, SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR (rapid influenza antigen tests and RT-PCR could also be used as a substitute).
That is, the longer the support time, the more serious the alternative trauma.
Recent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 .
