The resulting metric has a value of 0 for a model where the residual error vastly eclipses the observed data and a value of 1 when residual error is 0, i.e., a perfect model fit.
While these methodologies have led to impressive results, their accuracy is naturally limited as the amino acid sequence does not completely contain the protein's structural information, especially for very large protein complexes [12] .
We can order the network such that hosts with immunity to most viruses also have more matches to those viruses, and subsequent hosts (from top to bottom) are immune to subsets of viruses, via fewer matches ( Fig.
Significant changes in these indicators were usually accompanied by organ failure and cytokine storm syndromes (data not shown), which occurred at the end of disease course and thus could not reflect disease progression.
