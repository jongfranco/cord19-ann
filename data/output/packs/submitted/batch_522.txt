The drug 243 treatments also reduced the electrophoretic mobility of both, the glycosylated VP7 of SA11wt 244 and the non-glycosylated VP7 of the SA11-CL28 (Fig 6B) , suggesting that the change in 245 mobility of VP7 in cells treated with the drugs is not due to a change in glycosylation.

Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a R 0 of 3.39.
One of the more fascinating and relatively enigmatic aspects of CoV biology is that CoV virions bud into the lumen of the secretory pathway at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) , and then must navigate through the Golgi and the anterograde endomembrane system to be efficiently released from the host cell.
