The first invokes a direct interaction between a CPMP/CPP located within or on the surface of a Rab7 + late endosome and a component of the HOPS complex, perhaps VPS39 or VPS41, that effectively shuttles the CPMP or CPP from an endosome into the cytosol (model 1).

Giving the priority of 2019-nCoV detection to severe cases because of shortness of test kits in our hospital initially and potential false negative results of 2019-nCoV viral RNA detection in mild cases might account for this discrepancy.

In the S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 M pro , Gln189 is replaced by proline and this change is accompanied by a significant loss of flexibility; whereas the side-chain of Gln189 of SARS-CoV M pro is found to accommodate its conformation according to the steric requirements of the P2 substituent, the proline is less flexible, leading to a much smaller space at the entrance to the pocket.
