As contacts with persons outside the household are assumed to be less close, we assumed that the transmission probability for these contacts is lower by factor 0.25.
Using this approach, we sampled a large number of low-energy conformations of S-RBD in complex with ACE2 by preforming multiple, independent docking runs (i.e., simulations), and calculated their binding energies with a physically realistic, all-atom energy function for macromolecular modeling and design (Alford et al., 2017) .

Mechanistically, these 151 findings also suggest that both globins contribute to S. aureus species-specific hemoglobin capture.
There is evidence that both physical contacts [18, 6] and conversational contacts [8] may be relevant for capturing the transmission dynamics of acute respiratory infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza A/H1N1p, and for influenza, there can be substantial transmission in households [10] and schools [21, 5] .
Potent agonists of NF-κB, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) 28 and vgRNA, failed to induce NF-κB dependent gene expression in infected cells.

As the binding of ritonavir and lopinavir might lead to significant conformation changes of CEP_C30, there is no conclusion whether ritonavir and lopinavir are competitive or non-competitive, since both competitive and non-competitive inhibitors may significantly change the conformation of receptor.
