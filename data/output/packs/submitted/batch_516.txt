To quantify these three golden means, here we propose three easily calculable factors for model evaluation.
The majority of modeling studies assume that media exposure is driving behavioural changes, hence media exposure effects are incorporated into some kind of media function that modulates individual behaviors and may affect disease dynamics [19] [20] [21] .
Therefore, these locations outside the main epidemic area have been designated secondary epidemic areas**.

On the other hand, our finding highlights the different characteristics between COVID-19 (less superspreading) and SARS (more superspreading), which should be taken into consideration into mitigation.
We fabricated adjuvanted microspheres for this study as a room temperature stable dry powder using the Flow Focusing process to be 11µM in diameter so as to prevent more than one microsphere from being phagocytosed by any given antigen presenting cell (APC) at the same time [29] .
Moreover, the 48 rate at which infected individuals are removed from the population typically accelerates 49 throughout an epidemic as awareness of the infectious threat increases, 8 a process Drake et al 50 referred to as "societal learning."
The two tissue samples clustered under the same branch, where organoids showed consistent homogenous expression derived from different pigs than between 3 and 12-week cultures of replicate samples of the same organoid batch.
Furthermore, by integrating signals from four separate inputs into one output via a single fluorophore-quencher pair, the fivestranded 4GO probe could capture the viral diversity at a fraction of the cost of four individuallylabeled OSD probes.

We therefore conducted a study to describe the clinical spectrum of ocular symptoms and laboratory test in conjunctival swab samples, we found a rare case of nosocomial SARS-COV-2 infection with conjunctivitis in a nurse, which suggests that ocular transmission may be a potential route of nosocomial transmission of the SARS-COV-2.
In particular, uncertainty in transmission inference is newly captured by explicitly considering unobserved nodes in the outbreak tree and uncertainty of phylogeny through the use of multiple potentially competing phylogenetic inferences.

We define the width of the curve to be the proportion of time during which the antibody profile that is greater than or equal to some predefined antibody titer cutoff, z.
Additionally, our results support the findings of others that parkin can be degraded proteasomally [15] , [92] , [120] [121] [122] .
After obtaining λ , since residuals of log maximum likelihood estimation follows Chi-square distribution [13] , 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of log-likelihood, l, can be calculated.
also following recovery, and they did not undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis ( Figure S1A ).
Both tests can give spurious results in cases of extreme rate heterogeneity and sampling over time (Dudas and Rambaut, 2016) , but both tests have not been reported to fail simultaneously.

In the striatal function [1, 2] , dopamine (DA) [3] plays a critical role.
In essence, the choice of the most appropriate resampling method is far from being an easy task, especially when the identical and independent distribution iid assumption (Efron's initial bootstrap method) is violated.
Mice were weighed daily after infection, as weight loss is a 163 sign of ZIKV disease in immunocompromised mouse models and typically precedes lethality (2).
Secondly, the epidemic trend heavily depends on multiple artificial factors, including local medical resources, quarantine measures, and the efficiency of confirmation approaches, which should be explicitly modeled.
It was also detected in a host-virus system, where it was suggested to arise via negative frequency-dependent selection [17] .
Five microwells are 60 used per dilution: three for infected cultures and two for uninfected toxicity cultures.
For example, epidemiology studies found that males had higher incidence and mortality rates than females.
A strength of the model is that quantitative information about distributions of the latent and infectious periods, and the infectivity per day of the infectious period can be incorporated easily, such that if new and better data on those quantities emerge, the analysis can be updated quickly.

These simple structured models are widely used to study S-shaped cumulative growth processes; e.g., the curve of a single-wave epidemic and have been extensively studied in previous work [16, 17] .
We note that, when R(s) is piecewiseconstant, increasing the number of conditionally independent curves improves the probability of recovering p * .
There was 0% mismatch with all the strains examined, suggesting that these RT-LAMP primers would identify all 27 strains of COVID-19 examined (Supplemental Table 2 ).
In addition to the proposed adjustment, it should be noted that the 6 ascertainment rate of severe cases needs to be additionally estimated, and such 7 estimation requires direct measurement of the total number of cases or infected 8 individuals by means of seroepidemiological study or other testing methods of all 9 samples (Nishiura et al., 2020) .
