Evidence pointing to the person-to-person transmission in hospital and family settings has been accumulating [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .
In theory, long read sequencing mitigates this problem because long enough reads should unambiguously match a unique site on the genome, irrespective of low complexity or repeat sequences.
In summary, we propose that cGAS may become activated in response to RNA 383 virus infection, such as by virus-induced mtDNA release, but also contributes to RNA 384 virus restriction via constitutive, low-level innate immune activation, likely via 385 recognition of endogenous DNA ligands (Fig.
The resulting fragments will only be sequenced if they contain a poly(A) tail.

Once subcloned into this viral transfer plasmid, lentiviruses were generated by transfecting the BFP-CLC construct with the envelope plasmid VSVG (a gift from Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, Addgene #11912) and packaging plasmid pCMV-dR8.91 (a gift from Dr. Janet Zoldan).
From these stocks, 1:200 dilutions were made in fresh AML12 media.
First, the effect of antiviral treatment was not evaluated due to lack of controls.
The current generation of long-read assemblers is not well suited to reconstruct many viral genome architectures, such as nested ones.
Actually, except for the common topological localization, the predicted Ab-binding epitopes differ between the two proteins, both in their sequence and 3D structural organization (Table 1 , 2 and Figure 1 ).
Non-uniform refinement, however, produces a 3.6Å result that is substantially better than both uniform refinements.
