In this analysis, we used the estimated serial interval distribution for SARS (Weibull with mean 8.4 days and standard deviation 3.8 days (32)) and varied this assumption in sensitivity analyses based on observations that the serial interval for currently circulating human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 may be considerably lower (33) .

The sparsity of B t is assumed because N could be even larger than T in our case, which leads to very unstable estimations and problematic interpretations of B t .
indicated that it will peak in April with the infection rate staying put; it will reach a peak in May with the infection rate decreasing by 25%,; if the infection rate decreases to 50%, the epidemic will slowly increase in the first half of 2020 and will not reach its peak 9 .
