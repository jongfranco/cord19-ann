Since only de-identified data are exported from the clinical institutions, no PHI is sent to or stored on the cloud server.
These data suggest that, despite its two-fold reduction in mutation rate, 3D G64S is not mutation 194 limited, and that any adaptive benefit of a higher mutation rate is countered by the fitness cost of 195 increased mutational load (see Fig.
Despite numerous estimates of 2019-nCoV's R 0 (ranging from 1.5 to just under 4 [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] ), as we discussed above in the comparison of Ebola virus disease and 1918 influenza, whether-like SARS-2019-nCoV can be contained or-like 2009 H1N1-2019-nCoV will cause a pandemic depends largely on the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections.
As 405 can be seen from the model simulations (Fig.
For each country, we calculate contact rates between each age group after excluding data from holiday periods.
Although there are asymptomatic infected people, who can also be the source of transmission [1, 12] , in clinical practice, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 mainly suffer from systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue, respiratory symptoms like cough and expectoration, digestive symptoms such as diarrhea [2, 13] .

Another interesting research avenue would be to explore ways of integrating timely data from ProMED and HealthMap with delayed data from ground surveillance to generate timely insights into the spatial spread of an outbreak.
A similar trend was observed for
Due to the nature of the described method to date the infectious agent cannot be narrowed down, however this will be addressed by applying it to more specific syndromes.
5 Data collection and analysis of cases and close contacts were determined by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to be part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation and were thus considered exempt from 93% in resting state; (3) arterial oxygen partial pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤300 mmHg; 4.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor and transcription factor that is a key regulator of the fasting response.

Among these three fast-evolving proteins, we focused on the ORF8 protein as it is one of the so-called 144 accessory proteins, which does not participate in viral replication (32, 33), raising the possibility that it 145 might have a role in viral pathogenesis.
The Spearman's rank test was again consistent with the ML-DSP results seen 253 in Table 3 , as the k-mer frequencies at k = 7 showed the highest correlation to the 254 sub-genus Sarbecovirus ( for the correlation test.
As illustrated in Figure 6 (F), we can observe that while decreasing the detection rate would not affect the decreasing trend of the effective reproduction number, it however postpones the time when the threshold value of 1 is reached.
Additionally, quiescent human T cells re-enter the first S phase even when treated with siRNA to substantially reduce the amount of loaded MCM to ~5-10% of their normal loaded amount (Orr et al., 2010) .
In addition, this study also found that participants in the communities or administrative villages with isolators were more likely to using emotional-focused coping than those in the communities or administrative villages where was not affected or with diagnosed patients.
