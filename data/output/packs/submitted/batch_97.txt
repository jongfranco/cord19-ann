Since HNB is added in the LAMP reaction prior to the 370 process, the colour gradually changes from violet to blue as the dNTP's decreases as 371 amplification takes place.
For diagnostic purposes, RT-qPCR generally is more sensitive, provided that the primer binding sites remain conserved in the pathogen being tested.

This uniformity leaves high frequency noise to accumulate in disordered regions (under-regularization), while discarding resolvable signal in rigid regions (over-regularization).
If global mRNA decay is matched with a complementary transcriptional response, the transcriptional induction can outpace the decay.
