We therefore speculate that mucin-induced airway inflammation might trigger further production of MUC5AC leading to a vicious cycle which contributes to enhanced airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion to drive exacerbation severity in COPD.
Following the cases reported in other Chinese cities and overseas, the National Health Commission (NHC) of People's Republic of China confirmed the evidence of human-to-human transmission of such viral pneumonia [3] .
And  is the rate of isolation release, hence 1/14  = (the quarantine duration is 14 days).
We also see that at the steady-state density F = 1, this provides the reason as to why the agent steady-state predicted by the MFA is correct.
For these reasons, we rely more heavily on sequence length and similarity between the visited paths and the LR's to direct graph exploration across those regions.
