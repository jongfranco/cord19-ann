Second, the serial intervals from clear transmission chains, combined with information on the incubation period distribution, were used to infer the infectiousness profile as described below.
Mathematical models have an important role to play in preparedness for novel infectious diseases, allowing policy makers to plan for potential public health scenarios before they arise.
[2] [3] [4] [5] For SARS-CoV-2, evidence indicates that a high fraction of infected persons is infectious before they show symptoms (up to 50%), that a substantial fraction of infections may be asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, and that the epidemic doubling time in the absence of interventions is approximately one week.
In GSEA analysis, 50 hallmark gene sets in MSigDB [37] were used for annotation.

Differential gene expression analysis.
One 187 possible scenario is that identification of measles was worse at the start of the epidemic relative to later in the 188 epidemic, and that fewer measles cases were therefore reported in the early phase of the epidemic.
