We use data on the confirmed cases who left Wuhan between January 10, 2020 and January 23, 2020, to estimate K. Under Assumption 2, cases infected on Day will be detected on Day + , so the number of infected cases in Wuhan is + on Day .
The development of an analytical framework that accounts for potential cross reactivity in pan-viral serological data, and which provides probabilistic assessments of infections, is therefore an important advance.
