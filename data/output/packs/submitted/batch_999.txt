Next, a GA08 serotype specific primer set (in house validated set of primers used for diagnostics) was used on all samples from Run 1 (including five samples that were previously tested by the pan-IBV PCR) and four of 10 samples were positive.
To provide a benchmark for the performance, we note here that a single individual-based stochastic realisation of the code which implements multiple MDA treatment rounds and migration between 40 clusters of 500 people (each cluster corresponding to a different infectious reservoir) requires ∼ 20 minutes to run for 100 years on a laptop with a 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 4GB of memory.
* indicates p = < 0.05.
We created "case-control" tracks including coordinates overlapped (SD) and not overlapped (non-SD) by SDs in the IGHV/IGKV regions, and then carried out tests for enrichments of CH17 SNPs in these regions by permuting the SD and non-SD status for each IGHV and IGKV set of coordinates (Monte Carlo Simulations = 10,000).
