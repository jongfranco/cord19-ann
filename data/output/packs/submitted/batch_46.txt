Recently, a paper [89] suggested that rhodopsin dimerization is possibly critical for the formation of a stable rhodopsin-Gt complex and the stabilization of rhodopsin pigment structure, but not for G protein-dependent responses (Gt activation rates), using synthetic peptides derived from bovine rhodopsin TM regions to inhibit rhodopsin dimer formation: TM4 had the greatest affinity to the rhodopsin, with a calculated apparent Kd of around 0.5 M, and the TM1, TM2, TM4, and TM5 mixture was able to reduce the dimer from only ~65 to 40%, meaning that the interaction between two rhodopsins is stronger than this Kd value.

In both these study populations the susceptible subgroup of children were those who developed early allergic sensitization (7-10, 25, 42, 43) , and a variety of evidence suggests that the underlying mechanism involves synergistic interactions between atopic and anti-viral inflammatory pathways triggered within the infected airway mucosa (3) .
