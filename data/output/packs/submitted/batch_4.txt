The confidence interval probability is calculated by following the same procedure.
It is important to also mention that the approximate bound we obtain on the prevalence as a 'stochastic breakpoint' applies as more of a strict bound and hence does not exclude the possibility (or even high likelihood in some specific configurations) of elimination at a higher prevalence of 2%.

Mutations are then classified as either synapomorphies, shared variation derived via common descent or apparent homoplasies, shared variation derived from convergence, depending on how many times a given mutation has arisen in the phylogeny.
