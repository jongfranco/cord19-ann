The shear strains thus depend on the orientation of the cross sections with respect to the centerline (tangent), while the stretch measures the elongation of the centerline.
In contrast, mutations in the di-hexamer interface and around the CypA-306 binding loop on the hexamer surface had little effect on MxB binding.
