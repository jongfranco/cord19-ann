Then, the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and the estimated diagnosis dates of cure cases of COVID-19 were respectively calculated on the basis of the median death time or median cure time.
Since g is a distribution, the reduction needed to prevent invasion (or to eliminate disease) is exactly θ = R. We call θ the "strength" of the intervention; transmission is interrupted when the strength of the intervention θ is larger than the strength of spread R. We generalize this idea by allowing an intervention strategy to reduce K by different proportions over the course of an individual infection.
This makes it possible to predict ever larger density maps which allows for a more versatile application of the method.
Therefore, cellular mRNA decay agrees with the fast timing of translational inhibition and the loss of global protein synthesis.
In the next day, outcome could be any of the three: confirmed infection, discharged without infection, or stay in MO.
