Although, after 10 weeks, a fit to the Sierra Leone data set would have substantially underestimated the problem at hand, the fit at 20 weeks provided a much better ball park assessment of the final size of the Sierra Leone outbreak than could have been obtained with non dynamic modeling efforts.
Membrane proteins have different topologies in the lipid bilayer, with one or more TM segments composed of about 20 hydrophobic amino acids; After the N-ter signal sequence is cleaved, the protein has a new N-ter extracellularly, and thus with an additional hydrophobic segment as a TM, is just a type I membrane protein.
In practice, the choice of bioinformatics processing prior to the application of our Bayesian mixture analysis must be optimized for each application, and our processing pipeline has been designed with viral sequence identification from transcriptome sequencing as a main goal.

A filtration of a topology space K is a nested sequence of subspaces {K t } t=0,...,m of K such that ∅ = K 0 ⊆ K 1 ⊆ K 2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ K m = K. Moreover, on this complex sequence, we obtain a sequence of chain complexes by homomorphisms: C * (K 0 ) → C * (K 1 ) → · · · → C * (K m ) and a homology sequence:

A definition of contact that is too restrictive and inappropriate for the infection means some encounters may fail to meet the definition yet may be at risk of infection; these excluded contacts could be identifiable (light grey) or unidentifiable (orange).
We apply the criteria developed above to select among possible p-parameter (or k-grouped) renewal models.

• Exponential growth (EG), which assumes an exponential growth curve to the virus and estimates the basic reproduction number from the Lotka-Euler equation 14 • Maximum likelihood method (ML), in which the likelihood of the cases is expressed directly in terms of " on the assumption of a simple SIR model structure 15 • Sequential Bayesian Method (SB), in which the posterior probability distribution of the basic reproduction number is estimated sequentially using the posterior at the previous time point as the new prior 16 • Time-dependent reproduction numbers (TD), in which the basic reproduction number at any time point is estimated as an average of accumulated estimates at previous time points 17 These methods were implemented using the R0 package in R. 18 All these models require no assumption about recovery time, but in some cases require an assumption about the generation time of the epidemic.

The random variables X i and δ i are positive and are both assumed to be independent and identically distributed, i.e., X i ∼ f (x; Θ 1 ) and δ i ∼ k(δ; Θ 2 ), so that Y i ∼ g(y i ; Θ 2 ).
for a predictive model, though it is always the case in most published works!
