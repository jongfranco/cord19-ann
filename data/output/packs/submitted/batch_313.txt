A key feature of the method is that it provides probabilities that answer pertinent biological questions, in particular the posterior probability for the presence of a species in the mixture.
For example, CCR2-deficient mice exhibited reduced monocyte recruitment to the brain but increased mortality during West Nile virus encephalitis [14] and this effect was differentially regulated by CCL2 and CCL7, another CCR2 ligand [15] .

However, evidence on its effectiveness is limited and given the lack of specificity, it generates a high overhead of screened travellers uninfected with the targeted pathogen 4 .
To selectively label and manipulate piriform neurons that were activated during odor exposure, we used cFos-tTA transgenic mice (Reijmers et al., 2007) , in which the activity-dependent cFos promoter drives expression of the tTA transcription factor, and we stereotaxically injected in their piriform cortex Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVs) expressing Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) under the control of the tTA-responsive promoter tetO ( Figure 1A) .
There was also evidence of integration and coordination of responses at the transcriptional and translational levels.

Simply speaking, the termini of the linear segments making up the conformational epitopes could be aptly bridged with a number of Gly residues sufficient to approximate the distance in the experimental structure (Table 3 ).
All else equal, the discrepancy between resident and visitor prevalence is most pronounced if the visitors' durations 3 of stay are shorter, for slower-growing epidemics, and for longer durations of detectable infection; conversely, visitors are more similar to residents in their prevalence of infections if they stay longer, if the epidemic is growing faster, and if the duration of detectable infection is shorter.
