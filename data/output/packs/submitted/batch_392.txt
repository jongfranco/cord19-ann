Compaction is mediated by increased electrostatic interactions between charged blocks on the CTT sequence.
These results are consistent with a slight preference for frameshifting in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum, where RNA are less mobile and more efficiently translated (Voigt et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016) .

However, one of the biggest challenges is the accurate mapping of the raw voltage signal to bases ('base calling').
However, we did not detect a turnover of this protein since no difference in LC3-II levels could be observed when LecB-treated keratinocytes were incubated with either bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal inhibitor, or cycloheximide to assess LC3-II stability (SI Appendix, Fig.

As some miRNAs had no detectable pre-miRNA reads or vice versa, we used a generalized log odds ratio of miRNA-seq to pre-miRNA-seq reads (see METHODS) to compute a mature to precursor abundance ratio (MPAR) for miRNAs expressed in human HEK293T and mouse MEF cells (Tables S4 and S5 Among the maximum scoring high confidence miRNAs in humans was hsa-miR-338, which had no detectable pre-miRNA-seq reads and 1,358 reads per million (RPM) in miRNA-seq libraries (MPAR = 11.4) ( Table S5 ).

We consequently restrict ourselves to the first 60 days of the possible 107 outbreak, beyond which results from simulations would not correspond any longer to a realistic 108 setting.
Early after infection, E1A is expressed mainly as large and small 55 isoforms, but later in infection alternative splicing leads to the production of a 9 Svedberg E1A 56 isoform (E1A-9s) as well as low abundance doubly-spliced E1A-11s and E1A-10s.
