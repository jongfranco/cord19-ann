lions that were not resident in any pride) were excluded due to the difficulty of assigning environmental variables (see Confounding variables below).
The number of viruses whose median G4 count is significant at the 10% level is listed in Table 2 (virus names in Supplemental_Table_S3.xlsx) with the indication of whether this median count is either higher or lower than the G4 count in simulated sequences.

Some distinct aspects of MERS-CoV epidemiology could not be captured in our methodology, such as hospital outbreaks where R 0 is expected to be consistently closer to 1.0 compared to community transmission of MERS-CoV.
Due to the lack of antiviral drugs with confirmed efficiency on COVID-19, it is possible that some immunological parameters could be used as additional indicators to properly assess the virus activity and the needs for prolonged quarantine in asymptomatic patients.
Examples of redoxregulated proteins that rely on conditional disorder are involved in mitochondrial transport and assembly.
An approximated interaction matrix / %& is thus given by
Use the two-sample "ks.test" function in R to calculate the Kolmogorov-Smirnov ( ! )

Considering the existence of an infectious period, the transition time of R(t) will be different from that of I(t).
This is a heritability-like measure that partitions the overall phenotypic variance of an idealized future diallel experiment into additive, parent-of-origin (parental sex), inbred (dominance), epistatic, and other random/fixed effects categories in the diallel.
 , the infection ability of the patients in the latent period is the same as that of the patients with symptoms.
