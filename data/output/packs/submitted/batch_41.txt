These authors concluded, by comparing the structures at 0 mV (closed) and +100mV (open) that the motion of S4 was about 5 Å, which they associated with a "one-click" translation (meaning an arginine moved to the position of the next salt bridge to close the channel).

Assuming perfect intervention performance is not possible, the high feasibility parameters represent an upper-bound on the expected ability to implement interventions based on contact tracing.
Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate and only representative gels are shown.
This difference in viral replication 328 kinetics between the two types of PKR -/-MEFs may be due to differences in expression level and 329 activity of the PKR fragments reportedly produced by them; we have not assayed PKR fragment 330 production in our cells.

S 0 = S(t) + I(t) + R(t).
Comparing the models that include only some sources of uncertainty to the "all" model, we see that propagating error from the growth rate (which all but one of the studies reviewed did) is absolutely crucial: the middle bar ("GI mean"), which lacks growth-rate uncertainty, is relatively narrow.
