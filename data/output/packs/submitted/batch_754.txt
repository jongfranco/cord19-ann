While this type of analysis can produce a collection of local changes (mutations, insertions, or deletions) of the strains inside the quasispecies, it is not sufficient to infer the biological properties of the strains, which are more likely to be determined by multiple genes.

Another related technique, used in cisTEM [11] and its predecessor Frealign [12] , entails the manual creation of a mask to directly label a region of a structure that one expects to be disordered (eg., a detergent micelle), followed by low-pass filtering in that region to a single pre-set resolution at each iteration of refinement.
