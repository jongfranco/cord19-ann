Based on the formula of the generation interval, we know that b = 2 3 and n = 5, R Γ,g will be too sensitive on r, and we will choose (1.2) to obtain R 0 , and our main focus is to get an accurate and stable estimate for the growth rate r. The modified second order approximation to (2.6) is also important and has been widely used [11, 6] .

Finally, for the intervention scenario (iii), since we increase the hand washing engagement rate only at the source of the disease, prior knowledge of the source is required.
To address the need for rapid quantification of risk, while acknowledging the shortcomings of R 0 , we use network science methods to derive both the probability of an epidemic and its final size.
To probe the approximation more thoroughly, we also chose one disease with high variation in generation interval (canine rabies), and one with a high reproductive number (measles).

Finally, simulation showed that when infectiousness started at the same time as symptom onset, there would be a small proportion of short serial intervals (e.g.
These similarities give rise to taxonomically ambiguous, widespread and false assignments and thus need to be accounted for.
We did this by plotting the 19 number of species in which the ME would be detected as we increased the e-value cut-off (Fig.
