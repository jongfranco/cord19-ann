These observations underscore the need for additional models of FLC, including new cell lines.
However, further investigation of our methods 303 suggests that making a wrong distributional assumption can lead to biased estimates of 304 the mean and CV of a generation-interval distribution (Appendix A.3), even though the 305 gamma distribution "looks" indistinguishable from the shape of the intrinsic generation-306 interval distribution (derived from the SEIR model).
The geometric mean calculated from standard model basecalling routinely results in translocation rates between 8 and 9, which agrees with average translocation rates communicated by ONT (unpublished communications).
