where R t i is the reproduction number at location i at time t and p i→j is the probability of a case moving from location i to location j while they are infectious.
The low infection rate in our control population suggested that our method was reliable in early and rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections.
The high degree of autocorrelation evident for all the 589 parameters is due to strong correlation between the transmission parameters and the missing data, in particular between the 590 spatial transmission rate constantand the asymptomatic infection times.

For instance, antiviral drugs (such as zanamivir and oseltamivir/Tamiflu) are most effective in the first ~48 hours of symptoms [8, 17, 18] ; PRESAGED-enabled early warning would allow much faster prescription, use, and potentially more profound therapeutic impact for current dosage recommendations.
