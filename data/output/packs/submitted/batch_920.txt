For each study i, we construct a family of parameter sets by drawing 100,000 random samples from the probability distributions ( Table 2 ) that represent the estimates of R 0i and the assumed values ofḠ i and κ i and calculate the exponential growth rate r i via the inverse of Eq.
Using this model, we calculate the probability of each of the four outcomes, with the associated expected costs, by combining the data on the probabilities of infection, the estimated incubation period distribution, and plausible cost ranges for different outcomes.

Mapping of these glycans onto the structures of the trimeric S proteins revealed that some of these glycans contribute to the formation of a cluster of oligomannose-type glycans at specific regions of high glycan density on MERS-CoV S. Molecular evolution analysis of SARS and MERS S genes also reveals a higher incidence of amino-acid diversity on the exposed surfaces of the S proteins that are not occluded by N-linked glycans.

The resulting action of RNase L inhibits global translation, which puts all proteins, including IFNs, at risk of arrest during a cellular response to dsRNA.
Few studies have examined longitudinal colonization, however a recent study in African children reported S. aureus colonization in 42% of infants at 1 month and 12% at 12 months of age, a trend which was mirrored in maternal colonization rates (30) and is strikingly similar to the patterns we observed (41% at 2 months, 11% at 12 months).
