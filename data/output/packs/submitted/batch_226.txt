However, decreased eIF4E binding to the pGKL mRNAs does not substantially affect the performance of those mRNAs in translation, which suggests a novel mechanism of translation initiation independent of eIF4E cap-binding protein.

This could reflect a lack of saturation of RNA-capture screens or lack of expression of many other PRY/SPRY-containing TRIM proteins in the cell lines used for these assays.
