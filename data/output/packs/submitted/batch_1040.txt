An analogy might be how physics embraces different representations of the same process if they are more convenient or provide deeper insight-different coordinates systems, for example, or classical versus Lagrangian mechanics-even when they make the same predictions.
Hence, the mechanism by which coronavirus polymerases carry out de novo RNA initiation is likely to be distinct from either the picoronavirues or flaviviruses, but the nature of this mechanism remains unclear.
Kin selection theory, for example, has been enormously influential in part because it shows that social evolution can be understood from just a few important quantities: how a behavior affects the fitness of an actor, how that behavior affects the fitness of other individuals, and the genetic relatedness between social partners [1, 2] .

Furthermore, the mRNA target for this study was searched and aligned against human transcript and genome database and all the hits were identified as gremlin transcripts (see Supplementary Fig.
for the group of cities having similar rates of infection and recovery.
16 Because COVID-19 is more dangerous for people with comorbidity, 17 it is likely that people who have ongoing medical issues would suffer more during the outbreak and therefore we asked whether the participants had any chronic disease.
The background level of membrane release in the absence of protein was also measured by incubating SUPER templates in buffer alone.
In addition, disease severity and fatality were higher among the elderly compared with the rest cases.
The trees are very different (normalized Robinson-Foulds distance = 0.94 out of 1.00), indicating that recombination has caused the history of the specificity region to differ from the history of the rest of the protein.

We study how these quantities depend on the delay to diagnosis of cases and on the delay in contact tracing.
Examples that seem relevant to this outbreak include: changing reporting rates, reporting delays (including the effects of weekends and holidays), and changing generation intervals.
