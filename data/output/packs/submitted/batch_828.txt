The outer dotted lines are 95% CI.
The time delay distribution between illness onset and hospital admission may also be negatively associated with the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population [19] .
We fit the data to a gamma distribution and a log-normal distribution (and also an exponential distribution for the period from symptom onset to isolation) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and select the one with the smallest Deviance Information Criterion (DIC).

Our forecasts do not 393 account for possible unreported cases or changes in reporting over time; such gaps in 394 reporting can not be ruled out, though given the intense efforts at case finding that 395 started in July and carried forward, we think it unlikely that there were large changes in 396 reporting.
The real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction using the laryngeal swabs were performed as reported previously [1] .
For such strategies to succeed, drug targets that are shared across virus families 13 need to be identified.
The intervention speed increases slightly as proportion of early transmission increases because the subpopulation that the intervention fails to reach become relatively more important if late transmission is more important.
Another recommend detection method, sequencing, is widely applied for 52 pathogen identification and monitoring virus evolution 5, 6 including SARS-CoV-2 7 , but requires 53 expensive equipment, operator expertise, and > 24 h turnaround time, rendering it unsuitable for the 54 current crisis.
