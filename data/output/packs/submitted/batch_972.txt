Consistent with recent reports, our results suggest that 2019-nCoV is more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune functions of these patients [5, 6] , and 2019-nCoV-associated death is also related to elder age and underlying illnesses, especially hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease.
The localization of XP not only at the plasma membrane but also in the perinuclear region raises the possibility that XP may also have additional functions.
Consistently, we observed a strong correlation of initial MST and GST (R 2 =0.825, p-value<0.001) across most CC strains as well as B6J and DBA/2J strains (Fig.

Most of the health facilities are public, government-owned or non-governmental, non-profit organization under government regulatory in Malawi.
This is especially important as the method assumes no mechanistic link between an input sequence and the phenotype of interest, and the input sequence constitutes only a small fraction of the target genome without a wider biological context.

For each, one half of the data is the 'training set', and the other is held out for validation.
Moreover, the BRACA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is implicated in familial breast cancer, has been shown to interact with RNAs (Kawai and Amano, 2012) .
We can also see the large impact of instantaneously reducing contaminated water consumption on the number of infected individuals (in terms of both number of infected individuals, and the rate at which that impact manifests).

We have previously found that MNV infection results in 338 translation shut off and that this effect is at least partuialkly due to the activity of the 339 NS6 protease (Emmott et al., 2017) .

We found that ∆F/F hotspots do not necessarily correspond to high nIRCat labeling of the brain tissue, suggesting that the hotspot is a consequence of variation in dopamine release and not nanosensor loading in the tissue (Figure 3d , Figure S3 a-c).

We varied the tolerance as the data set became more complete to maintain a roughly 152 fixed rate of generation of filtered trajectories.
Similar to Mg 2+ ion, iron is also required by this bacteria, but its uptake from the host environment is more challenging as it gets sequestered by various host proteins like siderocalin, transferrin and lactoferrin leading to its unavailability in the host environment (Fig 2b) .
