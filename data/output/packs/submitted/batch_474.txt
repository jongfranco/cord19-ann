In addition to immunosuppressive activities, corticosteroid have an anti-inflammatory role to reduce systemic inflammatory, decrease exudative fluid in the lung tissue, promote absorption of inflammasome and prevent further diffuse alveolar damage, which can relieve hypoxemia and effectively protect the lung to prevent further progression of respiratory insufficiency [16] .
