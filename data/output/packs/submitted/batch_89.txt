Using near-isogenic lines and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 54 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene 55 (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance.
Another potential limitation is that it is difficult to control for all confounders, as smoking may be related to other unhealthy life habits 16 and multiple comorbid diseases 17, 18 .
Therefore, we suggest that α-coronaviruses have two subtypes 361 of NTD.
Maintaining personal hygiene (e.g., frequently performing hand hygiene, washing hands with soap and water) and cough etiquette (e.g., covering nose and mouth when coughing, correctly disposing wasted tissues after coughing) are also beneficial.
The basal and lateral localization of SrSeptin2 and SrSeptin6 in rosettes is reminiscent of 233 septin localization in polarized epithelial cells (Fares et al., 1995; Spiliotis et al., 2008) , in which 234 septins interact with the positive ends of microtubules that are growing toward the basal pole 235 (Bowen et al., 2011) .
