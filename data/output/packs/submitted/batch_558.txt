By simply measuring the fitness of the virus infecting a given host, we may predict the whole genomic profile of the host cell to characterize its state (molecular impact of infection).
The complex must not be so tight that, once the cavity becomes available, it cannot release the K + ; the cavity location is then of lower energy than the solution, so that the ion moves into the cavity rather than back to solution, and the current continues.
