We found that VP7 was not able to 398 trimerize (as judged by the lack of recognition of VP7 by MAb 159, which specifically 399 interacts with the trimeric but not with the monomeric form of the protein (18) The drug-induced modification of VP7 could, in principle, prevent its trimerization.
The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model has traditionally been used to study epidemic spreading with various forms of networks of transmission which define the contact topology [2] , such as scalefree networks [3, 4, 5] , small-world networks [6, 7] , Oregon graph [8, 9] , and adaptive networks [10] .

As shown in these figures, the transmission rate modifier πptq played an important roles in shortening the key turning points of the epidemic, and its effect on both estimation and prediction of the COVID-19 infection dynamics has been clearly demonstrated .
28 Additionally, it is possible that certain genotypes are better complemented to the S1 primers than others and may outcompete those isolates for amplification in the AmpSeq protocol.
The characteristics of these trials were summarized in Table 1 More trials on TCM treatment use 2 or more primary endpoints (PEs) than those on CDs or BTs (57.6%, 39.4% and 40.5%, respectively).

In a normal setting, contacts made at all of these locations contribute to the overall mixing pattern in a population, so we sum the contacts across the different locations to obtain our baseline contact pattern in the population before the outbreak (Fig 2, Fig S1 and Fig S2) .
Since there are 20 different types of amino acids occurring in nature its output has the same number of channels.
