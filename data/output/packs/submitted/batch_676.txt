Therefore, increasing sequencing depth might not significantly improve the coverage.
In such cases, we suspect that a single CAI observation is not enough to completely decipher the evolutionary patterns for such multi-host pathogen.
Given the potential for H5N1 viruses to trigger a 49 pandemic (1, 2), there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions to combat known 50 deficiencies in our ability to control outbreaks.
Such methodology can be applied to study diverse types of contagion phenomena, including the spreading of computer viruses, information, innovations, emotion, behavior, crisis, culture, etc.
In this approach, the raw current level data is decoded by averaging 2 sample points instead of 5, resulting in higher-resolution basecalling.
As in (28) , the LR sequence is first divided into solid regions (stretches of k-mers shared with the SRs) interspersed with weak regions (stretches of likely erroneous k-mers).

author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
14 In most cases showing altered tRNA diversity (8 out of 11), we found that the change in diversity 15 was also associated with significant shifts in GC content, so that species in clades without the tRNA 16 modification typically had more extreme GC3 values (i.e.

The MDL method it approximates has the desirable theoretical properties of generalisability (it mediates overfitting and underfitting) and consistency (it selects the true model with increasing probability as data accumulate) [10] .
In contrast, targeted NGS of specific viruses following their specific 311 amplification by PCR can be up to 2 times cheaper based on our experience (e.g.
It is therefore becoming increasingly evident that connected speech requires dynamic changes in the linguistic system, resulting in differing distributions of linguistic components compared to naming.
