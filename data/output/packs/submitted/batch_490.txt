The reaction was run in a thermal cycler (95°C for 10min, then 98°C for 15sec, 60°C for 5min for 10 cycles), then terminated by the addition of 2µl of stop buffer.
Previous investigations utilising defective interfering RNAs have 498 confirmed that no more than the first 604 nt of the 5' UTR and the entirety of the 3' 499 UTR are sufficient to allow both positive and minus strand RNA synthesis (34); it is 500 notable that this region only includes one-third of the U1 ORF (which starts at 501 nucleotide 524) and hence only this subdomain would be constrained by maintaining 502 two distinct functional roles.

The COVID-19 outbreak, however, began to occur and escalate in a special holiday period in China (about 20 days surrounding the Lunar New Year), during which a huge volume of intercity travel took place, resulting in outbreaks in multiple regions connected by an active transportation network.
Data on imported cases aggregated by location were obtained from the WHO technical report dated 4th February 2020 1 (a zero case count was assumed for all locations not listed).
Our approach is therefore a relevant tool to provide authorities 155 responsible for the preparations for a possible outbreak the possibility to know how much time 156 they have at their disposal to prepare complementary health infrastructures.
