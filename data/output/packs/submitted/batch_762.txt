We chose RefSeqs as the basis for our library for this reason, after reviewing, updating and in some cases creating new RefSeq records with the intention that they would serve as references to the wider research community beyond the scope of VADR-based annotation.
The mammalian toroviruses (EToV, BToV, Bovine TCH5 nidovirus, GToV and PToV) do not carry the MTase signature sequence, and thus the latter is associated so far to nonmammalian Tobaniviridae.
To confirm a CC0 license.
We truncated our estimate 10 days before the quarantine to account for the estimated time between infection and case detection, assuming a 5-6 day incubation period ( 4 , 7 -11 ) followed by 4-5 days between symptom onset and case 9 .
The method requires O(|V | + |E|) memory for storing the graph, and O(|V |) memory for storing (log) conditional probabilities.
Numbers of estimated transitions between human-infective/transmissible (IT) levels 1, 2 and 3/4 across all genera (N=39) compared for three methodologies: 1) counts of the number of internal node changes, transitions, observed from discrete traits analysis* and 2) number of expected transitions (mean) from Markov jumps, both with input trees generated by Bayesian interference; 3) number of expected transitions (mean) from the parsimony reconstruction method with input trees generated using maximum likelihood methods.

The two secondary structure profiles show a strong a correlation (0.92).
and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was 1.17, which was the lowest except for SNU01 (another strain of SARS-CoV-2), indicating that their codon preference was almost the same; the second lowest codon usage difference was 2.41 that was detected between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (Fig.
Our sample of patients is small.
This is consistent with the fact that bats 430 serve as a reservoir for many coronaviruses and that bats have been observed to have 431 some of the largest and most diverse arrays of APOBEC genes in mammals [66, 67] .

To give the most comparable results we used a constant population size coalescent model, as this is the demographic function for each deme in the structured coalescent model.
Learning has been efficiently used for classification of DNA sequences, using one-hot label encoding and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) [18, 19] , albeit In particular, for the case of viruses, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) genomic samples might not be identified by BLAST, as there are no reference sequences valid for all genomes, as viruses have high mutation frequency [20] .
