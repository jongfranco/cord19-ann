For this reason, we 156 consider our estimate that 74% of L3/4 viruses arose from L1 lineages to be conservative.
This seems to be because ISD was already high at the time of de novo gene birth; today's ancestral overlapping genes have indistiguishable ISD from their pre-overlapping homologs (p = 0.6), while those pre-overlapping homologs have higher ISD than non-overlapping genes (p= 2 × 10 −3 ) ( Figure 4B ).
In particular our analysis of the hvPPI network revealed that all the viruses have evolved to target proteins that are central and have strong control over the human interactome.

The onset-tooutcome delay phase is the period between the onset of the last detected case to the outcome (recovery or death) of that case.
We would like to emphasize that in the absence of detergent, a single sample application resulted in a very dense distribution of particles, even at less than half the concentration.
To alleviate these issues, we allow different choices of parameters governing hybridization for different subsets of input sequences, so that some can have probes designed with more relaxed assumptions than others.

While many interactions within these classes share common binding sites or homologous binding sites (Figure 2 ), there are also connections between these groups, for instance via inhibitory antibodies which bind to a protease active site, or due to common binding regions of proteins in the immuoglobulin superfamily, such as antibodies, TCRs, MHCs and β-2 microglobulin.

Lastly, it is important to consider missing cases due to imperfect surveillance during the outbreak and asymptomatic cases that potentially act as invisible transmission sources during the outbreak and could prolong the time to declare the EO (18, 19) .

1, 4 The COVID-19 is a beta-CoV of group 2B with at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV 5 and is the seventh member of the family of enveloped RNA coronavirus that infect humans.
However, consider the fact that the diversity of CoV is reflected in the variable S-proteins and the gene of S-protein is easy to mutate, [12] [13] [14] [15] it is not economical to design a new drug to prevent the RBD binding to host receptor directly.
