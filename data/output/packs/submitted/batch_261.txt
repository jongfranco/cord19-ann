The volume per disordered domain (IDP) attached to the BAR scaffold was estimated as the volume of a cylindrical shell surrounding a membrane tube, with thickness equal to twice the radius of gyration of the IDP domains, divided by the number of BAR domains in the scaffold.
Given a skewness, a disease will be more stable if it has frequent small positive deviations rather than infrequent large deviations -hence a smaller kurtosis -as stochastic die out could easily occur before any of those large infrequent deviations occur.
The insight into whether the patients in the hospital will be cured or die remains unclear.
To investigate viral homologs of the four insertions, we further performed a BLAST sequence search of these four insertions against the non-redundant (NR) sequence database, restricting the search results to viruses (taxid:10239), but leaving other search parameters at default values.
