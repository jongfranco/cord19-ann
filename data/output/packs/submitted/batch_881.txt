For example, with one command, users can easily plot the distribution of cases on the maps of the world, China, and even individual provinces ( Figure  1 ).
Lastly, the conservation of the ligand bind sites for many putative inhibitors previously developed for SARS and MERS suggests the development of antiviral drugs as a promising direction for addressing this new global health threat.

Proteins represent an essential building block in all organisms.
2 (a), we can see there exists two seperatrices.
Thus, the determinants of steady state intracellular FLC 220 levels are complex, and include uptake and efflux rates as well as other factors (Fig.
Infected is an intermediate state, where the patient becomes a confirmed infected case.
Then the confidence scores were averaged across all the proteins of a certain virus (e.g., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2), and the corresponding p-values were obtained by z-test.

Skygrid comparison between whole and fragmented genomes.
The persistence of ZIKV-positive fetal HCs in full-term placentas regardless of the period at which infection occurred indicates that ZIKV can persist in the placenta for several months after maternal infection and may provide a viral source for continued fetal infection.
This makes that the oro-fecal route should be considered as an important complement of contact with the virus (recent information sustains this hypothesis 11 ).This was observed at the Amoy Gardens cluster of cases for SARS 12, 13 .
