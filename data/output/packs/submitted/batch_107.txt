The BLASTn result for each bat assembly was further processed to group single hits into potential transcripts as follows: first, for each query sequence q ∈ H, hits of q found on the same contig c and strand s were selected (hits c,s,q ) and the longest one, q 1 , was chosen as a starting point, so that trscp c,s,q = (q 1 ).
On Jan 24, 2020, British scholars Read et al [5] estimated that the number of 2019-nCoV infection cases in Wuhan would reach 190000 on Feb 4, which obviously overestimated the development trend of the epidemic.

Pockets of virus transmission that occur in countries with inadequate reporting can therefore facilitate 'hidden' outbreaks, increasing the risk of infected travelers causing outbreaks in new regions of the world.
