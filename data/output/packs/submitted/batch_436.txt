However, R0 > 1 does not guarantee that a single exported (and untraced) case would immediately lead to a major epidemic in the destination country as government responses such as border control, isolation of suspected cases, and intensive surveillance should serve to reduce opportunities for transmission to occur [17] [18] [19] .

The divergence time of the viruses deduced is about 91-214 days before the submission of the first isolate.
Although much is known about the process of evolution in bacteriophages and many emerging zoonotic viruses and how they adapt to new hosts, this mechanism is still unclear for virophages and satellite viruses.
Because different strains could have very different biological properties such as virulence, transmissibility, antiviral drug resistance etc, characterizing the genetic diversity within viral populations is very important for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.
According to our methods, the haplotype number estimation only depends on the alignment results of contigs.
Consequently, we hypothesized that the cost of resistance should be expressed mostly when cells are rapidly dividing.

PW, XH, YCL and JYW collected and verified all infector-infectee transmission data.
The presence of any positive signal is calculated by multi-input Boolean 'OR'gated logic processors in a single one-pot reaction that directly analyzes crude biological samples and provides a visual yes/no readout for any ZIKV variant within 60-90 min.
To directly investigate the interaction between Ca 2+ and MERS-CoV FP, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).
This inability to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination could be 381 explained if at any given moment there were only low levels of ubiquitinated PKR present in the 382 cell.
The core region of similarity to the TRS-L motif (CUUAACAA) is typically flanked by a 3′ adenine (A) or uracil (U) residue, and a preference for A/U residues is also seen immediately upstream of the core sequence.
On the other hand, the amount of variation explained, given by the adjusted R square value, differs between models.
