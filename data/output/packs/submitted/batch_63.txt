This may suggest that indeed the UK and some parts of Europe are still in a situation where air-traveller targeted interventions may substantially delay major local outbreaks, however, under-reporting of cases is likely and with quickly rising case numbers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Korea and now Iran and Italy as well this situation may change rapidly in the coming days and weeks.
Furthermore, they reveal that uridylation is more common in pre-miRNAs, especially after the first nucleotide, whereas adenylation is more common in mature miRNAs.

While the QK criteria offers a more stable and reasonably performing MDL alternative, it is less interpretable.
Intuitively, the CFR provides some information on the number of cases, as it represents the expected number of deaths per case, so that CFR -1 corresponds to the expected number of cases per death.
Day of illness is the number of days from the date of symptom onset (day 1) until the date of specimen collection.
Table S1 ), because of a single nucleotide deletion in that region one cannot translate a full-length ORF10 in RaTG13: the resulting frameshift causes a premature stop-codon when translating the sequence.
