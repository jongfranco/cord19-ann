Given that most of the members of the coronavirus family cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection and most people have not yet received nation-wide alert about the novel virus during that period, it could be possible that the confirmed case number among actual infected cases is very low, probably similar to influenza reporting rate, which is only about 1% [7] .
