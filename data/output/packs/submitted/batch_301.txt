Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections [1] .
Of these, 38 correspond to mutations which destabilise the complex in the presence of the background mutation, but stabilise in its absence (destabilising sign epistasis), while 113 correspond to mutations which stabilise the complex in the mutant background but otherwise destabilise the complex (stabilising sign epistasis).
Of these, 213 were considered 222 to be highly supported by the data, either due to being identified in at least 10 223 chimaeric reads or containing the full 5' leader and TRS sequence.

the glutamic acid to lysine amino acid substitution at position 627 in the PB2 protein of avian influenza A viruses confers the ability of the virus to replicate in mammals (Subbarao et al., 1993 ) and a small number of amino acid substitutions in Parvoviruses are associated with adaptations to different hosts (Chang et al., 1992) .

Effectively by definition, each of these three codons is excluded from large portions of sequences with long rORFs (mean usage per associated amino acid in RdRp ORF = 0.0037, 0.0054 and 0.0056, respectively), but are 17-to 26-fold more common in those alphanarnaviruses without long rORFs (mean usage per associated amino acid = 0.0973, 0.0896, and 0.1277, respectively) ( Figure   6A ).
