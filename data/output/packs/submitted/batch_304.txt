Two recent assessments of IGK allelic variation --one of a public dataset of 435 expressed sequences 33 , and a second of deepsequenced antibody repertoires from four individuals 34 --concluded that, unlike IGH, IGK allelic datasets are likely to be mostly complete, as only two putative novel alleles were identified from these analyses 33 .

While this assumption had a 275 relatively small impact on the estimated R, it greatly impacted the inferred λ z (which is measured 276 as the number of spillover events per locality per day and is therefore strongly affected by 277 changes in the assumed number of localities) (S1 Fig).

This leads us to hypothesize 439 that fine-tuning of HA protein expression to fit the temperature of the host target organs 440 could be another viral adaptation strategy, besides well-known mechanisms related to 441 receptor use, polymerase activity or immune evasion (8).

A 2 µl 1:10 diluted aliquot of this mosquito 238 sample was directly assessed by LAMP-OSD analysis.
However, our key qualitative insights likely are robust to these uncertainties, including extensive pre-quarantine COVID-19 exportations throughout China and far greater case counts in Wuhan than reported before the quarantine.
More specifically, expression was modeled as a function of treatment while probes for a particular 105 gene were treated as a random effects using the nlme::lme function in R. The data contained seven treatments:

The genomes were rearranged as described in the text to place the integrase gene at the 5' end of the phage genome, and then genes were displayed as ordered by the modal frequency of each gene.
Notice that in sensitivity analysis on γ A , we find that when the recover rate of asymptomatic patients γ A gets smaller, the expected containment time is longer.
The neurofilament-M disordered domain is similar in length to that of amphiphysin (438 versus 383 amino acids, respectively) but is not involved in endocytosis and therefore contains no binding domains for endocytic proteins.
