To contrast these results with the 119 scenario of the next measles outbreak in the absence of vaccination, the same model used to estimate the size of the 120 2017 outbreak in the absence of vaccination was used with two changes: 1) the total population size was increased to 121 870,534 [1] , and 2) the proportion of the population that was assumed to be susceptible at the start of the outbreak 122 was estimated as su instead of s0 (Table 1) Figure 3 ).
