miscalled homopolymer runs which, in our experience, typically affect less than 10 consecutive bases.
Secondly, each phylogenetic tree contains at least n-1 free parameters, so it is not surprising then that models attempting to recover 2 independent trees for both genomic fragments resulting from alternative tree topology analysis of MERS-CoV with highly correlated genealogies are penalized for the extra parameters introduced by a second tree.
Complementary oligonucleotides encoding the mutant phages were designed and synthesized by IDT.
Although 508 this could be viewed as a limitation of our work, because individual subjective decisions 509 cannot be reproduced, we suggest that the explicit description of a partially subjective 510 process is a strength.

The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to the length of one calibration window before the end.
Since the sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number methods take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we think they are more accurate than the exponential growth and maximum likelihood methods especially in the late stage of an epidemic.

In our modified SIR model, recovered population R was extended to include those cured, died, and isolated in hospital because they cannot transmit the virus.
It is not uncommon for analogues to be synthesized during the drug-301 development process that lose specificity or even function by a different mechanism of action, 302 single-cell analysis has the potential to reveal changes such as these at the start of the analysis 303 instead of much, much later in the development process.
