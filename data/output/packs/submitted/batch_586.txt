A potential limitation of our study is that it was carried out using samples collected from the upper airway and not the lung.
Samples from nasopharyngeal washings and naso-and oropharyngeal swabbing are the most common methods of sampling the airways of sick children, and whilst ideal for molecular diagnostics, they are less suitable for phenotyping of airway resident immune cells using conventional cytometry techniques.
