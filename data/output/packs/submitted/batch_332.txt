Another possible approach to local control of regularization is to formulate the problem in another basis.
The second, R 1 j (t), is the number of offspring that a virus strain j would produce by escaping protection from hosts via a single mutation (1-match) at time t. These two components can be added to obtain the 'potential reproductive number' of a virus strain j, R pot j (t) = R 0 j (t) + R 1 j (t), which quantifies the contribution of a viral strain and its potential progeny to the population growth, conditional on escape.
