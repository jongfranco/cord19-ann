The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is likely similar to closely related coronaviruses such as the virus that causes SARS, in which the virus enters the cell, releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm, and synthesizes negativesense genomic and subgenomic RNAs from which viral mRNAs and a new copy of the positive sense viral genome are synthesized (Fig.
Although 8 December, 2019 is assumed as the starting point for exponential growth of the cumulative incidence in Scenario 1, there is still uncertainty using this date as a proxy for the beginning of exponential growth due to inconsistencies reported on illness onset for the earliest reported cases [2, 5] .
However, despite these discrepancies, the weekly incidence derived from ProMED and HealthMap was moderately to highly correlated with that reported by WHO later (Pearson's correlation coefficients aggregated across the three countries 0.44 and 0.74 respectively, p value < 0.001, also see Fig 2 for weekly trends).
We performed a series of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results by considering the outlier data point on February 1, and varying incubation and infectious periods, transmission ratio between unascertained and ascertained cases, and initial values of the model (Fig.

This quantity can vary around the value given in table S1, but the value chosen is an appropriate approximation for ssRNA(+) viruses.
However, functional analyses reveal that both elements promote nearly identical rates of -1 PRF, suggesting that this element has been structurally and functionally conserved.
Because of the numerous recombination events occurring within the S gene of Alphacoronavirus 108 1 species, current classification of Alphacoronavirus 1 strains are often not well defined and fail to 109 recapitulate the previously established serotype demarcation.
Additionally, if we set any one of E, I 1 , I 2 , or H to zero, the other three state variables representing infected classes must also be zero.
Shortly, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT, SIGMAFASTTM protease inhibitor cocktail), sonified (Branson Sonifier, 3x 20 s with 40 % duty cycle and output control 3-4) and cleared by centrifugation (Sorvall Evolution RC, SS34 rotor, 15,000 g).

Clearly, given that the primary evidence behind the derivation of -RNA 677 viruses from within dsRNA viruses comes from deep phylogeny, extreme caution is due in the 678 interpretation of this observation.
For mysterious reasons, human coronaviruses use peptidases as their receptors [27] .
These results demonstrate that lower fidelity polymerases will have a high likelihood of incorporating 2'-F,Me-UTP and inhibit viral RNA replication, whereas high fidelity enzymes, more typical of the host DNA and RNA polymerases, will have a low likelihood of being inhibited by 2'-F,Me-UTP.
