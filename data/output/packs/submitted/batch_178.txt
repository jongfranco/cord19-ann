), better isolation effectiveness ( ), and shorter delays in tracing a contact ( !! )
These resuspended virus-laden aerosol originally may come from the direct deposition of respiratory droplets or virus-laden aerosol onto the protective apparel while medical staff having long working hours inside PAA, as shown from the SARS-CoV-2 deposition results in ICU room.
Through crystallographic analyses of a total of six inhibitor complexes of three different proteases in this study, we found the a-ketoamide warhead (-CO-CO-NH-) to be sterically more versatile than other warheads such as Michael acceptors (-CH=CH-CO-) and aldehydes (-CH=O), because it features two acceptors for hydrogen bonds from the protein, namely the a-keto oxygen and the amide oxygen, whereas the other warheads have only one such acceptor.
Muc4 exhibited strong correlation data and low expression in the relevant founder 187 strain.
This facilitates the avoidance of direct physical contact, thus reducing the risk of exposure to respiratory secretions and preventing the potential transmission of infection to physicians and nurses.

What is the best strategy to perform synonymous recoding to achieve attenuation?
In models for directly transmitted diseases, this can come from realistic demographic and behavioral characteristics, for example the contact frequency between individuals [20] , mobility patterns [21, 22, 23, 24] , and from clinical and epidemiological characteristics like the duration of the serial interval [25] .

Our numerical implementation allows consideration of a higher number of protospacers than before; for simplicity, in our study we used a number of protospacers that is still below those typically observed but have compensated with a lower value of offspring produced (burst size; see SI.)
As mentioned above, the narnavirus RdRp is more closely related to the RdRp of bacteriophages in the family Leviviridae than it is to the RdRp of other (+)ssRNA viruses.
