Hence, an alternative scenario is that the eradication of Tupanvirus was caused by its hypersensitivity to virulent virophage; thus, any other virulent virophage might provoke the same effect.
In the 'virus-diversification regime' (VDR), virus strains proliferate and diversify while in the 'hostcontrolled regime' (HCR) host strains are able to constrain virus diversification and lead to their extinction ( Fig.

We assume that individuals with severe symptoms do not attempt to travel, though travellers may develop severe symptoms en route.
The temperature-sensitive 442 expression of IBV HA is an intrinsic feature seen in the absence of any other IBV proteins, 443 hence it is unrelated to the reduced RNA synthesis seen with some temperature-sensitive 444 IBV strains (80).
The result demonstrates that R e (t) has dropped sharply from 3.34 (R e (1) = 3.34) on January 20th to 0.89 (R e (12) = 0.89, less than 1) on January 31st, 2020, which implies that the integrated control strategies implemented in mainland China excluding Hubei has successfully reduced transmission intensity and prevented the epidemic growth in a short time frame.
In physics, Fourier transform, a common signal analysis method, is used to reveal the intrinsic relation between the time function and the spectral function in the signal and to extract the signal of the highest frequency sequence by using all the temporal information of the signal to deal with the high frequency noise.
