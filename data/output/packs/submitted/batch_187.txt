Notably, we did not observe modified bands for TRIM25 in the RNA pulldown assays because the total protein amounts loaded on the gel were one order of magnitude lower than those in the overexpression experiments.

Interestingly, PEBCA particles more potently activated Nrf2 than PBCA particles; whereas the maximum PBCA-induced Nrf2 activation was reached already at 25 µg/ml and then decreased at higher concentrations, Nrf2 was accumulated in a dose-dependent manner by PEBCA particles (Figure 6A-B) , resembling the transcriptional activation of ATF4 ( Figure   5I ).
