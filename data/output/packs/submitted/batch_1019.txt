In conclusion, our results show that isolation and contact tracing are not expected to be able to fully control outbreaks of COVID-19, but are still important ingredients of effective containment strategies, as they are expected to reduce growth rates and increase epidemic doubling times.
Potassium ions play a crucial role in cellular entry; however, a role for sodium or calcium ions is 208 not as well described.
A key limitation of the paper is that we are not able to disentangle the effects from each of the stringent measures taken, as even within this four-week sampling period China enforced such a large number of densely timed policies to contain the virus spreading, often simultaneously in many cities.
The range of melting temperatures for the three transitions can be obtained from the temperature dependence of the various states f α (T ) (α=F, I1, I2 or U) given in Fig.
