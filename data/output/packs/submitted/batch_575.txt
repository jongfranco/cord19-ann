Our simulations show that the probability of cases arising in the future after this 132-day (42 + 90 day) period from the outcome of the last detected case is generally lower than 5% except in rare scenarios with a high reproduction number during the 'decline' phase (Web Figure 2) .
The dileucine motif of Arabidopsis tonoplast-localized ion transporter VTI1, EKQTLL, interacts with AP1 γ1/2 and σ1/2 subunits, but not with AP3 δ and σ (Wang et al., 2014) , raising the possibility that these subunits could be interacting partners of OuMV MP instead of AP2M.
On the other hand, humans with an APOC3 mutation benefit from a favorable lipoprotein profile, increased insulin sensitivity, lower incidence of hypertension, and protection against cardiovascular diseases (Atzmon et al., 2006; Jørgensen et al., 2014; Pollin et al., 2008) .

One can typically state that if the number of human hosts in which the parasite population grows (net growers) is one or more in a given cluster or community of people, then the chances of parasite extinction in the long-term are low.
Therefore we hypothesize that conformational changes in the phage upon interaction with receptors are key to effective host recognition.
