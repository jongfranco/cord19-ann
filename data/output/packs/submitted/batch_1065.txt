In contrast, when we more moderately overexpressed N-terminally-tagged parkin using the minimal human parkin promoter, leading to ~8-fold overexpression above endogenous parkin levels, we observed a L-DOPA-induced loss of exogenous parkin similar to that observed with the endogenous protein (40.7 ± 0.7% exogenous parkin loss with L-DOPA, p = 0.0003, N = 3) (Fig.
These suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic emerging, measures of prevention and protection certainly should be taken to avoid infection, but the sufficient dialysis remains the key issue for patients to survive the epidemic.
