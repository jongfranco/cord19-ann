the undocumented infections are no longer contagious (Figure 2) .
Next, we determined whether the decrease in titer was due to reduced virus production in infected cells or the result of fewer cells being infected.
Of note, varying migration patterns in different locales may affect the spread of airborne and direct contact human-to-human transmitted disease.

The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Three correlation models were tested: hyperbolic (double-log), exponential (single-log), and linear.
The case of Winter holidays occurring during the fadeout of the epidemic shows that a small reduction of the total number of cases can still be achieved with school closure after the epidemic peak, whereas other studies showed minimal impact [45] .
Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, which was later named 2019-nCoV ('n' stands for novel), was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, asthenia and pneumonia among people in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020) .
Skin temperature was depressed by at least 2 C for 15 min and 1 C for 20 min, likely because evaporation of volatile components lowers temperature.

Here R t is the reproduction number at time t (the average number of secondary cases per infected individual) and ω is the distribution of the serial interval (the time between onset of symptoms in a case and their infector).
We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively.
Illustrating the latter of these two scenarios, we found that for IGHV, SNP density was highest in regions including segmental duplications, particularly those with >95% sequence identity with their paralogs; similar trends were not noted for SNP density estimates calculated within non-SD repeat regions (Table 2) .
It is widely accepted that in addition to direct interaction 56 with TCR, MHC-I engagement of the CD8 coreceptor is required for the functional activation 57 of CD8 + T cells (14).
The Rfamderived ncRNA alignments were further split into snoRNAs (Tab.
Because the adjuvanted 200 microsphere vaccine used in this experiment incorporates a TLR-4 agonist, we dosed 10 mice with adjuvanted microspheres without peptides and found the level of protection after exposure to 100 PFU EBOV to be statistically no different from that seen in PBS buffer controls.

Number of correctly assigned reads to each organism at the genus and species level.
As clearly seen in Figure 1 (C), the predicted numbers of ) (t C and ) (t I increase dramatically, which are far beyond the observed numbers after Jan 21.
Thus, where there are cases in which the PDB reports a mutant form and the entry corresponds to the reverse mutation back to the wild-type, the affinity of the former appears in the "wild-type" column and the latter in the "mutant" column.
states can be explained by less Pol II molecules engaging into transcription at gene promoters.

These probabilities can then be used to estimate transmission parameters incorporating the uncertainty around the true infector.
The entire cysteine side chain is an S and an H, so ionization leaving only S makes a significant difference.
The increase in coverage depth varied between samples, likely in part because the samples differed in their starting concentration and, as expected, we saw lower enrichment in samples with higher abundance of virus before capture ( Supplementary Fig.
From the analysis, it is observed that the total traffic alone cannot predict the power of an airport to spread the disease (comparing left and middle panels in Figure 2 ), but should be accounted alongside with the location of each spreader airport and the spatial correlations with other influential airports in the network.
