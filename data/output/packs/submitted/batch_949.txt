For all these places, our results suggest there could be a consideration of expanding testing of pneumonia or influenza like illness cases beyond those who have currently travelled, to find community transmission as soon as possible after it occurs, as has been ongoing in Singapore 19 and has been recommended recently in some areas of the US 22 .

In particular, the initial COVID-19 reproduction rate in South Korea was smaller than that in the Guangdong Province.
Initially, these infections were thought to result from zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission; however, recently published evidence [2] and the exponential growth of case incidences show compelling evidence of human-to-human secondary transmission fueled by travel, with many cases detected in other parts of the world [3] .

Nucleosome density variation was instrumental to distinguish if linker lengths and phasing distances depended on nucleosome density and/or remodeler features.
This intentional simplification was justified for the sake of speed, such that preliminary models are generated that describe the gross structure of PDCs and do not attempt to describe internal inhomogeneties.

We therefore expect that starting from observed generation 220 intervals and correcting for the right-censoring effect, will allow us to estimate an "effective" 221 generation interval that accurately reflects dynamics of spread.
The fact that we observe that particular reversion in the NP-Exo(-) could indicate that for L MOPV there is a constraint at this particular position.
For future research on predictors of severity, research should aim to include greater detail on specific conditions, including how well controlled chronic conditions were before and during admission.
We generate two prediction profiles with the default settings of the IUPred method, one for the native sequence corresponding to the state achieved through cysteine stabilization (redox-plus) and one calculated for a modified sequence with cysteines residues mutated to serine, corresponding to the state without cysteine stabilization (redox-minus).
