It is understood that some of these annotations may be wrong; unfortunately, a complete evaluation would require a full structural elucidation, which is experimentally infeasible.
From an uninformative prior distribution of each parameter bounded by published observations, we simulate five infection generations of 500 initial individuals and record the simulated serial interval (i.e., the time between symptom onset in infector-infectee pairs).

Geospatial mapping and computational modeling platforms are in development to characterize the regional spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens.
approach is that the transmission tree is built using all the sequences collectively by iteratively labeling the internal tree nodes rather than treating pairs of sequences independently, thus some transmission hypotheses conceivably could be more readily rejected by looking at multiple farms simultaneously.
