This quarantine-all policy could result in the illness of people who, if not for the quarantine, would never have been exposed to the pathogen.
This may lead to that the estimated R0 was not robust as we 168 do not hold enough evidence and information to the presence of asymptomatic carrier, 169 those data were not included in the estimation model.
Additionally, we have developed coupled Part 234 vectors to accommodate rapid cloning of small guide RNA (sgRNA) expression by oligo annealing for CRISPR/Cas9-related genetic constructs.
To model the updated fine-scale epidemic dynamics of all individual cities in mainland China, we proposed a spatially explicit approach.

Our findings agree with previous results in the literature that have reported that a reduction as large as 90% in traffic flow has a limited effect on the spreading of the disease.
Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of Cα atoms between the two complex structures is 0.703 Å, indicating an almost identical structural conformation (Figure1B).
