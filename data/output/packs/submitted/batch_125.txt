In light of the results presented here, this observation is compatible with a scenario in which Rif R mutations cause a perturbation of transcription-translation coupling by virtue of reduced RNA polymerase processivity, and translation inhibitors promote re-coupling by decreasing ribosomal activity.
The latter name is more common, but the former is possibly more accurate [24] .

Because this variant might affect drug responses by regulating gene expression levels, we looked for the co-existence of drug-response QTL and expression QTL on chromosome V. We identified 2,540 eQTL and nine eQTL hotspots, including a region on the center of chromosome V. We calculated the mediation effect of all 49 genes with an eQTL that maps to this hotspot region and identified scb-1 as a candidate gene whose expression influences the responses to several chemotherapeutics.
