This alert was added to fit the design of the NCBI submission interface for norovirus in which submitters are asked to specify the genogroup, and it is triggered only when VADR judges that the sequence belongs to a different genogroup.
Developing an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is therefore a research priority.
