Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES) (8) , regardless of symptom level, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for these pathogens, as infection may contribute to onward transmission, and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome, even without primary symptoms (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) .
To draw closer attention to the treatment effect BLUPs, we indicate strains that are at the extreme for those phenotypes with a substantial mean shift in Figure 3 and Figure S3 (in the direction consistent with this mean shift) in the rightmost columns of Table S1.
Furthermore, RNA modification detection from single-molecule sequencing is a current bioinformatic frontier, and algorithms and tools are under active development.
Discovery of nucleoside or nucleotide analogs and host-targeting antivirals (HTAs) are two main strategies for developing BSA [7] [8] [9] .
The basal expression of IFITM3 in lung epithelial cells was shown to be highly 328 variable between patients, but still showed significantly higher expression than 329 that of lymphocytes (p=0.0438), and a comparable average expression level 330 to that of myeloid cells.
This may increase the ratio of intron:intergenic 294 sequence ( Fig 3F) , but also falsely indicate that splice variation is more prevalent for this gene.
Human-created niches may also impose quasi-domestication and unintentionally favour some traits and genetic variants with side-effects linked to them 3 .
11118), selecting positive assays in T cell, B cell and/or ligand contexts.
The frequency of mixed respiratory viral 33 detection varies from10%to 30% in hospitalized children [5] [6] [7] .
It might due to that the treatment time window is important for the therapeutic regimen of sepsis, but difficult to grasp.
Indeed, we detected all 339 these previously described low pathogenic avian viruses in our sample set, and coronaviruses and 340 influenza A viruses were shared across different Anseriform species.
This study has several limitations.
Therefore, we turned to our previously described cytosolic fractionation assay to calculate the cytosolic concentration of 4 R and 5 R relative to 2 R .
discrete-time, continuous models, network models, etc) and the particular biologies of host-pathogen systems (e.g.
Using the exponential growth rate, we next estimated the range of the basic reproductive number, R0.
Having demonstrated that bacteria exposed to a prodrug exhibit a binary outcomesusceptibility (i.e., death) or defiance (i.e., survival)we next sought to determine whether the behavior could be quantified by a metric of resistance that could be generalized across broad treatment conditions.

The discontinuity in expression coding is the result of removing from analysis all genes with changes between -1.2-fold and +1.2-fold at 24 hpi, leaving 6764 genes in the heatmap.
Usually, RNA viruses have high rate of genetic mutations, which leads to evolution and provide them with increased adaptability (Lin et al., 2019) .
Taken together, these data suggest that cells in the first G1 after G0 load MCM slowly.
The model currently lacks inter-species evolution modeling and as sequencing technology advances there will be opportunities to better measure within host viral populations [28] and the affects on the genetic features of the recipient host's initial seeding population.
This suggests that there are shared biological processes for sensitivity for MST and GST, but these factors can be decoupled as shown in CC058 and CC032.
