It is particularly striking in the case of LE19 : at time 0, we observed the 3 species of secondary structures (migration for type A : 19 , B: 18 and C : 17 nucleotides respectively) and with time the top band-product disappears to the profit of an RNA of 17 nucleotides.

We defined an infection (or viral) episode as a group of consecutive weekly specimens from a given individual that were positive for the same virus (allowing for a one-week gap to account for false negatives and temporary low shedding).
The active site, located in a shallow groove between the two b-sheets, carries six key residues conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins: His235, His250, Lys290, Thr341, Tyr343, and Ser294 (Fig.

This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that while NSP12, NSP7 and NSP8 all individually recognize RNA with no or poor affinity, the complex of NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 is significantly more capable of binding RNA 8 .
Unfortunately, the incidence was accompanied by high mortality rates (9.6% for SARS-CoV and 34.4% for MERS-CoV), indicating that there is an urgent need for effective treatment at the beginning of the outbreak to prevent the spread (7, 8) .
