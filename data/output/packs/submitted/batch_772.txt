Therefore, male patients may be more prone to die from SARS-CoV-2 because of the high expression of ACE2, though further research on the mechanism is needed.
Thus, ORFX is efficiently translated but has only a minor (if any) direct effect on viral RNA replication.
We have offered an alternative, proton transport, which would provide the gating current, and would be able to open and close the gate (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) , but must show that the evidence that has been interpreted in terms of the standard model can be interpreted without it.
