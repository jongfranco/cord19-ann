consecutive days, and allowed for a 48-hour recovery before measuring transcriptional response 200!
Synapomorphies, on the other hand, are states that are shared by two or more taxa through common descent and thus necessarily are those mutations that have occured exactly once in the phylogeny.
Many more cases are likely to be symptomatic (fever/cough/myalgia) but may not require hospitalisation.

Another consequence of charge transfer is the change in electric field and potential in the neighborhood of the transferred charge, which again cannot be accounted for in an MD simulation in which charge does not transfer.
It should be stressed, that further model refinement is recommended in order to obtain more accurate and detailed models, using initial parameters suggested by the pipeline, and as necessary additional penalties as required (such as increased penalty for looseness and/or discontinuity, a higher number of experimental points and dummy beads in the MONSA grid, free ellipticity parameter for MEMPROT, etc).
It certainly could be employed to model the spread of epidemic.
