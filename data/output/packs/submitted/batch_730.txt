Pathoscope refines this process by penalizing reads with ambiguous matches in the presence of reads with unique matches and enforcing parsimony within a Bayesian context.
Finally, to compare the enrichment in different feature classes, characterized by different sizes, a normalization step was performed.

Until recently, although some studies have been done to predict the spreading of this new disease using air and 281 other forms of transport information [6, 7, 27, 28, 29] , none of studies were designed to estimate the dynamics 282 of the imported and secondary cases.
Because the S2 subunit appeared to be a symmetric trimer, we performed a 3D 61 refinement imposing C3 symmetry, resulting in a 3.2 Å-resolution map, with excellent density 62 for the S2 subunit.
However, there is an emerging understanding that the structural behaviour of IDPs is often context-dependent: a disorder-to-order or order-to-disorder transition can be induced as a result of binding to specific macromolecular partners, undergoing post-translational modifications, or changes in environmental factors such as pH and temperature [5] .
This drop was more pronounced for the PTC mutant (5.5±0.7% wt in BSR cells and 4.1±1.7% in Huh7.5.1 cells) than for the AUGm mutant (AUG to ACG; 17.9±0.1% wt in BSR cells and 13.2±0.3% in Huh7.5.1 cells).
We aim to estimate the effectiveness of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation for delaying the onset of sustained SARS-CoV-2 spread in previously unaffected regions.
Once the liquid in the reservoir was depleted, 40 μL of 10 μM dopamine in PBS was added.
For the between-city transmissions, population flow from Wuhan poses a risk for new infections in other cities, with one week lag in the first half sample, and with two week lag in the second half sample.
Although the majority of the patients did not have an exposure history of the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the clinical characteristics of these patients are very similar to those reported in previous studies [2, 4, 7] .

We will avoid the issue of model selection itself [52, 53] -i.e., if one fits various models to data with different numbers of parameters, then how does one decide which of these models best fits the data in an information theoretic sense-since this is also a research topic that attracts considerable attention.
