These actions that affect both, susceptibles and nonsymptomatic infectious individuals, not only protect susceptibles from acquiring the infection but also remove a substantial fraction of the entire pool of susceptibles from the transmission process and thus indirectly mitigate the proliferation of the virus in the population in much the same way that herd immunity is effective in the context of vaccine preventable diseases.
