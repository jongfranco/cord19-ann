Relative licensing window time: Licensing window time divided by Cdc6 peak time.
Two Abl kinases, Abl1 and Abl2, are expressed in human cells, and are involved in several cellular processes ranging from embryonic morphogenesis to mediating viral infections (6, 7) .
Thus, the transmission rate β indeed varies over time, which should be accounted in the modeling.
Most differences can be observed between the 24 h virus-infected and all other samples, that seem to show no clearly distinguishable expression pattern.
Nevertheless, this picture of virus-plant interaction may be biased by the limited number of viral genotypes analyzed in this work.
In the former case the time coordinate refers to the 17 time that has evolved since the infector of an infected person was infected.
This is consistent with the likely requirement for leaky scanning to access the downstream ORF on each sgmRNA (see Discussion) .

Given that SNP density within V gene coding regions in the CH17 haplotype was also higher in IGH compared to IGL and IGK, it could be speculated that mechanisms associated with an increased number of polymorphisms locus-wide in IGHV, could by default, result in greater IGHV gene diversity and a more variable expressed antibody repertoire.

We assume that past cases caused secondary transmissions independently (i.e.
This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.
By immunofluorescence microscopy, the different forms were present at 151 variable levels, with 10 to 70% of the cells showing staining under standard culture 152 conditions ( Fig.

61 Network analyses that describe the connections of different host species in terms of 62 parasite sharing have proven useful in analysing host specificity and parasite spread [10, 11] , 63 particularly since they offer the opportunity to explore community-wide pathogen spread (the 64 distribution of a pathogen among host species, a pattern emerging from past and 65 contemporary host shifting events that connect host species as nodes in a network).
This broad inhibition 198 indicated that the antiviral mode-of-action is unlikely to rely on the viral fusion process, as 199 changing the surface glycoprotein does not affect antiviral activity.

2E ) and were also slightly more likely to be near the nuclear periphery (Fig.
The finding suggests that provinces with better healthcare resources, greater disease prevention efforts, and more mature infrastructure may have more capacity to manage disease outbreaks and maintain faster responses as the outbreak evolve.
It appeared to be substantially facilitated by a secondary propagation route, thus substantiating the beneficial effect of an effective quarantine.
ZIKV was first isolated from a Rhesus monkey in 1947 [4, 5] .
We relied on officially reported statistics, which may not represent the change of actual case counts over time, but rather a reflection of testing and hospitalization capacity.
