For each ward, we assume that individuals contribute to the force of infection in their "home" ward during the night and their "work" ward during the day.
To determine whether IL-33 exerts a similar effect on IFNG transcript stability, human NK cells were incubated with IL-12 alone or in combination with IL-33 for 6 hours in conjunction with pretreatment with R-1503 or vehicle control.

The extended Bayesian skyline plot and multiple change-point method use piecewiselinear functions and apply Bayesian stochastic search variable selection [12] and reversible jump MCMC [24] to optimise p. These algorithms, while capable, are more computationally demanding, and lack interpretability (their results are not easily debugged and linear functions do not possess the biological meaningfulness of constant ones, which estimate the harmonic mean of time-varying population sizes [32] ).
latent periods were fit using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, also known as particle filtering.

It has previously been shown that replacing Ser 284 , Thr 285 , and Ile 286 by alanine residues in SARS-CoV M pro leads to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity of the protease, concomitant with a slightly closer packing of the two domains III of the dimer against one another (Lim et al., 2014) .
Here we decided to test this scenario as a regular closure given that -in a broader context -authorities in Belgium are currently discussing whether to modify the school calendar for pedagogical reasons: the aim would be to reduce summer holidays and redistribute holiday periods throughout the year [54] .

Mathematically, this corresponds to the time t at which : θ I t " 0 or the gradient of 9 θ I t is zero.
One difference is that our method incorporates putative unobserved farms into transmission hypothesis tests, which help prevent over confidence in certain transmission inferences.
