While there is currently no consensus on how to define such sites, we believe this to be a conservative definition, as this type of pattern is unlikely to result from e.g.
In addition, we found that more than half of all single nucleotide deletions occur in homopolymers, and most of these streches that coincide with a deletion are three or more nucleotides long (see Supplemental Fig.
Another key assumption of our model is the homogeneous values of bending and Gaussian moduli (Model assumption (g)).

Although the mechanism by which this gene causes 56 variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the 57 CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between 58 the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance.
