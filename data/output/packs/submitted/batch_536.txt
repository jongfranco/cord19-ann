By fitting our epidemiologic model to data on the first 19 cases reported outside of China, we estimate an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days (95% CrI 6.26 -9.66 days) and a cumulative total of 12,400 (95% CrI 3,112-58,465) infections in Wuhan by January 22, 2020 (Appendix).
These estimates may depend on what proportion of cases are identified, and whether the health system is over capacity.
