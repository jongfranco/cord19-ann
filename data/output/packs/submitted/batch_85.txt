Tracing goes back in time to trace all contacts during the infectious period of the index case.
We conclude that oxidative stress plays a role in only one of these pathways because parkin mutants deficient in binding phospho-Ub were only partly protected from L-DOPA-induced loss, whereas they were fully protected from loss induced by the oxidative stressor hydrogen peroxide.
A similar pattern is seen for the four seasonal human coronaviruses: HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E (hereafter collectively referred to as "seasonal CoVs") (Al-Khannaq et al., 2016; Friedman et al., 2018; Galanti et al., 2019; Góes et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2017; Killerby et al., 2018) .

Total RNA from an ultracentrifugation pellet was fragmented and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with R6 primers using RevertAid reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by second strand synthesis with the NEBNext Ultra II Non-Directional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs Inc. USA).
However, the perfect linkage disequilibrium between serine, tyrosine (position 10), and threonine (position 12) makes it impossible to disentangle the three amino acids in a statistical framework; a subset of the amino acids, or all three (that is, the YST-motif) may be key to disease onset.
As the disease was introduced into other geographic regions, many schools closed in response to the first observations of infection.
