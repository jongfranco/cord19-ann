The red horizontal dashed line indicates the R t = 1 threshold.
When viewing the BLUPs, it is important to keep in mind that given the small sample sizes for each parental strain, comparisons between the effects of individual pairs of parental strains are not necessarily significant, even when the overall effects are highly significant.
On 178 the other hand, the number of asymptomatic cases is expected to have a significant impact on the 179 disease dynamics at later stages, when a substantial proportion was infected.
In particular, the first 6 residues in the IS4 fragment "QTQTNSPRRA" from 2019-nCoV are identical to the bat CoV, while the last 4 residues, which were absent in the bat coronavirus or SARS-CoV, have at least 50% identity to MERS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1.

390 We show that single knockdown of none of the 18 TTSPs had an impact on IBV replication 391 in Calu-3 cells, and also dual knockdown of TMPRSS2 plus another HA-activating TTSP 392 had no effect, supporting the hypothesis that IBV can rely on redundant proteases for HA 393 activation.
To broadly assess the extent to which such discrepancies in incidence would impact the quantification of transmissibility throughout the epidemic, we estimated the time-varying transmissibility, measured by the reproduction number R t (the average number of secondary cases at time t per infected individual [19] ), using the incidence from each of the three data sources (Fig 1) .
