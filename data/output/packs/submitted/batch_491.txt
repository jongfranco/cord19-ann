Nonetheless, our model provides a very reasonable estimation of the propagation of average numbers of exposed, infected and recovered individuals, despite missing details of fluctuation (e.g., sudden surge due to a superspreading event).
In spite of the considerable threat posed by SARS-CoV and related viruses, as well as by MERS-CoV, it is obvious that the number of cases so far does not warrant the commercial development of an antiviral drug targeting MERS-and SARS-CoV even if a projected steady growth of the number of MERS cases is taken into account.
Although host range studies have generated mutants of other phages that can switch to utilize alternative receptors when under selection pressure [17, 18, 26, 27] , an innate ability to recognize multiple receptor types is not a common phenomenon, making Sf6 somewhat unique.
