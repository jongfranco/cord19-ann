Seemingly symmetric atoms also do not have the charge symmetry that is typically assumed, e.g., the amines (NH1 and NH2 in the pdb notation) that are part of the guanidinium ion; these effects are small on a percentage basis, but, leading to energy differences larger than k B T, would lead to differences in structure that cannot be taken into account in a strictly classical computation.
