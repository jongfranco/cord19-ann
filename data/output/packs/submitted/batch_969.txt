The structures show glucose present in the active site with no clear proximity of active site residues D282, M519, and R600, β-linked substituents beyond a 161 hydroxyl are sterically blocked, and thus we conclude that the β-glucose appears in the active 162 site after cleavage of α-linked substrate and subsequent ring opening of the α-glucose product.
