The time when increases at the fastest rate.
Therefore, it is of extreme importance to briskly define the odds ratio for mortality adjusted to comorbidities which are highly prevalent globally, according to age and gender, in order to prevent COVID-19 specific mortality.

All the viral antigens were detected 312 in cell culture supernatants, as well as in cellular lysates (Fig.
Second, because the final clinical outcome of 319 majority of the reported cases is typically unknown during a growing epidemic, dividing the 320 cumulative reported deaths by reported cases will underestimate the mortality rate early in 321 an epidemic [17] .
When M ij = 1, there is a probability p that the host strain is lysed and correspondingly, 1 − p that it survives and the virus is eliminated.
To this aim, the various components of the host antiviral defense, including the transcriptional induction of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, such as apoptosis, are subjected to stringent regulation by both positive and negative mechanisms 8,9 .

These results are sensitive to a number of key assumptions: with increasing R 0 , less heterogeneous R 0 or less effect of traveller sensitisation the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible We find a potential role for interventions targeting air-passengers to delay major outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in previously unaffected regions as long as implemented when there are only a few infected travellers per week.
