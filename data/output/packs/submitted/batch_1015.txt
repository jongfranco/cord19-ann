As the number of cases in China approaches one million, such reductions have a limited effect on the risk of outbreak.
We note that, unlike more general inferences of selection 339 from changes in viral diversity, our approach evaluates selection in terms of specific variants conveying In the light of our study, we propose that the term used in some analyses of viral transmission, of a 345 'selective bottleneck' is ambiguous, failing on the one hand to distinguish changes in a population arising 346 from selection and those occurring through stochastic change in the population, and on the other to 347 distinguish between selection for more rapid within-host selection or for inherent viral transmissibility.

Meanwhile, most patients developed fever, cough, dyspnea and markedly decline in oxygen saturation, which are the early clinical manifestations of ARDS.
Our analysis showed that if the outbreak occurs in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask would appear in less than a week and could be substantial under the existing public health measures.
