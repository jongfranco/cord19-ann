Additionally, for the purposes of hypothetical cost calculations, we assumed that an individual who becomes symptomatic with the disease of interest while under active monitoring gives rise to no secondary infections, while an individual who develops symptoms after his/her active monitoring period ends could give rise to as many as 4 new Ebola infections (an upper estimate based on prior research (16, 17) ).
It is nevertheless important to control for the large effect of frame while testing and quantifying other hypotheses.
The data in this analysis starts from Jan 21 and currently it ends at Feb 28.
These results are consistent with high incidence of MERS-CoV in camels (Müller et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2014; Ali et al., 2017) , allowing for co-infection with distinct genotypes and thus recombination to occur.
Generally, we refer to small and large genomes as those below and above 500Mb, respectively.
On the left, we assumed R loc = 1.4 and baseline θ, and with these parameters, outbreaks will likely occur in high risk countries as the case number approaches one million.

Our results revealed that main symptom of NCP patients manifested as fever (85.7%), cough (80.9%), followed by shortness of breath(42.9%)and fatigue(28.6%),diarrhea and muscle pain,which was consistent with previous studies.However,a large clinical cases(1099 cases) study by professor zhong et al [7] found that only 43.8% showed fever in the early stage, but up to 87.9% showed fever after hospitalization.It dmonstrated that fever is closely related to the development of the disease, therefore fever as a screening indicator may miss a large number of early patients.
Since a large number of proteins are involved, we only highlight a few top pathways here.
Unfortunately, mosquitoes are most commonly identified using morphological taxonomic keys.
Thus, reducing ACE2 expression by siRNA or other drugs may be a direction for drug development.
236 In addition, we knocked down FOXO3a in AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells and found that 237 knockdown abrogated AVAN-induced effects on IL-8 expression during IAV-BJ501 infection 238 ( Fig 5P) .
Perhaps not surprisingly, figure 7 is qualitatively similar to figure 5.

However, the same studies typically do not show significant conservativeness of transitions.
Using this approach, we compared estimates of R 0i of index cases on day 1 to R 0i estimated from 158 cases with onset on days 2 to 4 of the outbreak (excluding days with no reported cases).
The date of disease onset was defined as the day when symptoms were first noticed or the day when the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples from asymptomatic patients was positive.
The graphs in funnel plots of fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are basically symmetrical, which preliminary indicates no significant publication deviation.
