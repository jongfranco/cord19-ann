Clonal mapping of mutational neighborhoods with 50 clones involved relatively small sample sizes but allowed unambiguous identification of single, double, and triple mutant combinations.
If this is the case, then one may hypothesize that for unaffected individuals or those without (or with minimal) lung involvement yet (as could be the case for some subjects at the early stage of disease), a lower level of ACE2 expression on lung cells may be beneficial in reducing susceptibility to more sustained infection by reducing viral entry.
The abundance differences in the second and third data set are 0.06 and 0.03, respectively.
