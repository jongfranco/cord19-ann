This is again a clear case of different remodelers generating different nucleosome positioning, although starting from the same SGD chromatin, which argues for remodelerspecific rulers governing nucleosome positioning.
Note that caveats to our analysis here include varying the population number well beyond the prior limits used in our short sensitivity analysis -in such situations it is possible for apparent thresholds to go much lower or higher, e.g., consider the small, but non-negligible probabilities of sustaining transmission below a prevalence of 1% for much larger population numbers than those studied here in Ref.

The two methionines provide important interaction points for the P2 substituents of inhibitors; while these interactions are mostly hydrophobic in character, we have previously described the surprising observation of the carboxylate of an aspartic residue in P2 that made polar interactions with the sulfur atoms of these methionines.

In practice, it is often necessary to insert gaps between some of the characters of these sequences to obtain an optimal MSA-in some cases, there may be sections of the MSA that cannot be aligned reliably.

To quantify the relative contribution of immunity versus seasonal forcing on the transmission dynamics of the betacoronaviruses, we adopted a regression model (22) that expressed the effective reproduction number for each strain (HKU1 and OC43) as the product of a baseline transmissibility constant (related to the basic reproduction number and the proportion of the population susceptible at the start of the season), the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the same strain, the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the other strain, and a spline to capture further unexplained seasonal variation in transmission strength (seasonal forcing).
