Furthermore, while 56 little sequence homology was detected among these SREs, we showed that they share 57 similarity in their secondary structure; reinforcing the idea the SRE may function as a platform to 58 recruit a protective protein complex as previously observed (19) (20) (21) .
Allowing for age-dependent susceptibility substantially increases the amount of variation in scaling (and thus in basic reproductive ratio) by country, and in particular can lead us to predict much larger scaling factors.

From this perspective, virus surface-assisted nucleation might have evolved as a mechanism by which viruses modulate the host's extracellular environment by catalyzing the phase transition of certain peptides from soluble to insoluble forms; a phase change that could lead to toxic gain or loss of function or both.
However, if this is not enough to control outbreaks, then additional resources may be needed for additional interventions.
The size of the moving window reflects how quickly and smoothly changes in the data should be realized by the model: longer moving windows tend to produce smoother estimates, but the model may be less sensitive to abrupt changes in the data (e.g.
