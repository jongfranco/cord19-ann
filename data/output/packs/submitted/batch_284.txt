These data suggest that knockdown of HOPS but not CORVET inhibits trafficking of 2 SiR to Lamp1 + LEs and LYs and is consistent with model 3, in which CPP/CPMPs require HOPS to reach a favorable environment for escape.
Once internalized, virus particles move through a dynamic network of 61 endocytic vesicles, which undergoes gradual sorting and complex maturation events.

Based on our model, the risk of undetected circulation correlates both with air travel connectivity and (inversely) to outbreak detection capacity, but could have happened in virtually any location worldwide leading to the potential risk of self-sustained transmission, which may be an early stage of a global pandemic.
Figure S3 corresponds to the C-terminal sequence of the human Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27.
Alternatively these may derive from 260 autonomously replicating defective interfering RNAs, rather than multiple 261 independent RNA translocation and reinitiation events.

Both methods work with unassembled sequence data and they are not currently setup to incorporate an initial short read assembly step, which could be achieved by assigning a higher weight to contigs formed by multiple reads.
For surfaces functionalized in this way (Piehler et al., 2000) , we expect a PEG density of ~0.75 molecules/nm 2 , corresponding to 35 roughly one PEG-Biotin per 7nm x 7nm area on the surface.
The use of this tokenisation is motivated by previous work on phylogenetic profiling and gene sequencing [6, 13] that suggested that codons suit well for assessing similarities (and dissimilarities) at the gene, chromosome, or genome levels [6, 14, 22] .
