For each pair of entities (e 1 , e 2 ), there are usually more than one sentence describing the underlying relations.
Chemical inhibition was not as effective as genetic removal (which increases cost on average by 28%) ( Figure 4C and D), as may be expected, since stability, diffusibility across the bacterial envelope, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RHI001 in vivo are unknown, and potentially suboptimal.

This simplifies further if we make the substitution c = u/r, and use ∂c/∂r = (1/r)·∂u/∂r -(1/r 2 )·u and ∂c/∂t = (1/r)·∂u/∂t, yielding (1/r)·∂u/∂t = D·[(1/r 2 )·∂/∂r(r·∂u/∂r -u)], and finally ∂u/∂t = D·∂ 2 u/∂r 2 .
These two viruses, i.e.
The lack of absolute correspondence is not surprising, given that the experimental data is derived from a skewed set of HLA restrictions (largely HLA A*02:01), and that our HLA class I prediction strategy targeted a more limited set of alleles that were selected to represent the most frequent worldwide variants; at the same time, the class II predictions are expected to cover 50% of the class II responses (18) .

This includes that the relevant virus species is explicitly acknowledged along with the viruses included in this species by following the ICTV naming rules (Box 4) which, regretfully, are rarely observed in common practice, contributing to the proliferation of mixing viruses and species in the literature (and the authors of this paper wish to acknowledge that they were also not immune to this problem in several cases).
Residues following olefinic amino acids were coupled twice.
Shortened 23S rRNA reads (variants 4, 557 5) and the overall visible 3´ to 5´ coverage drop can most likely be explained by fragmentation and 558 degradation during library preparation, secondary structures that prevent efficient loading into 559 the nanopore or truncation of RNA reads caused by physical artifacts that have been described 560 before and include problems during RNA translocation or disruptions of the ionic current 561 signal 13,52,56 .
