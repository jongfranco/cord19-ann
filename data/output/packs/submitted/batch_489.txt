In order to test if Ca 2+ is required and which residues within the MERS-CoV FP are necessary for its coordination, we generated a set of mutated S proteins in which we substituted negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues in the FP with alanine (A) ( Figure 1A ).
Furthermore, the cytokines levels in CLP mice challenged with PA were also much lower in contrast with sham mice challenged with PA, demonstrating that bacterial challenge could not induce pro-inflammatory cytokines release in sepsis-induced immunosuppressed mice.
