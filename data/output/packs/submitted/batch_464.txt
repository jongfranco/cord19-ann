To further characterize the efficiency of frameshifting, we quantified the precise number of frameshifted versus non-frameshifted ribosomes per translation site.
We estimate the epidemic doubling time outside Hubei to be 4.0 days (range across provinces of 3.6 -5.0 days) and estimate the epidemic doubling time within Hubei to be 7.2 days, consistent with previous reports (5, 9, 16, 17) .

We note as well that weights can have other applications in probe design, e.g., if there is a reason to prefer some candidate probes over others due to base composition.
We hypothesize that many of the cases with no known travel history in the early period were indeed travelers that contributed to disseminating SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.

The central role of modelling is to estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0 , defined as the expected average number of secondary cases infected by a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population, as well as the effective reproduction number, R t , defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case during an epidemic.

Ignoring the travel ban since January 23 could also produce much smaller growth rate in our model.
Such efforts exist (e.g., [16] ) but have difficulties reaching a wide audience because prominent scientific publication outlets are reluctant to accept data analysis tutorials or reviews.

Although procalcitonin level was increased in over one-third (28.4%) of the patients, the median 0.03 (0.02-0.06) was close to normal range.
While the full meaning of this observation is not clear to us, it seems that these viruses possess far less G4 patterns than they could have, but at the same time they are able to cluster their relatively few G-islands in more G4 patterns than expected.
To normalise recombinant IFIT proteins and complexes, membranes were probed with anti-penta-His (34660, Qiagen) and quantified using ImageJ.
[2] [3] [4] The activated host immunity is characterized as lymphopenia, cytokine release storm (CRS), and dysfunctional immune responses to virus-specific antigen.
