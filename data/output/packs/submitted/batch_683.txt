In the face of such a sudden disaster as COVID-19, these psychological symptoms have manifested in both doctors and patients.
We assumed that incidence among travelers from each country followed the same temporal pattern as local incidence but the two differed in magnitude by a factor Ꮃ, which could be due to differences in exposure or health-seeking behavior between international travelers and the general population.
Macau and Taiwan both have frequent traffic flows to Hong Kong 24 , so we added = = 2 and = = 2.

The decreased activity in case of SARS-CoV M pro and the total inactivity against HCoV-NL63 M pro indicate that the n-butyl chain is too long for the S2 pocket of these proteases, whereas the slight improvement against EV-A71 3C pro and CVB3 3C pro is probably a consequence of the extra space that is available to long and flexible substituents because of the lack of a lid covering the enterovirus 3C pro pocket.
If variation in the generation time (i.e., κ) increases, then some new cases will be produced before, and some after, the mean generation time.
