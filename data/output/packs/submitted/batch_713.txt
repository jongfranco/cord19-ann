A successful TCI against 3CL pro must first be able to fit in the binding site of 3CL pro with an appropriate pose that keeps its reactive groups close enough to the Cys145, which then undergoes a chemical step (nucleophilic attack by Cys145) leading to the formation of a stable covalent bond as presented in the scheme below:

Segments of these two viruses generally fell into 239 the geographically isolated "Eurasian" clade, with the exception of the NP segment that fell within 240 the "North American" clade, thereby demonstrating intercontinental reassortment in Australian 241 waterfowl viruses (Fig S12, S13) .
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had been shown to be one of the main receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells [9, 10] , while ACE2 was at high expression levels in the kidney, vas deferens and testicular mesenchymal cells [11] .SARS had been shown to cause orchitis and affect spermatogenesis function [11, 12] .Although acute renal impairment had not yet occurred in pediatric cases, .
After 30 mins of incubation, cells were washed three times using phenol-red-free complete DMEM to remove any unconjugated fluorophores.
One 500 renumbering scheme, for example, is to label the center cell γ, δ, occupied by individual 501 α, as γ, δ = γ, δ 1 , the cell to its immediate west as γ, δ + 1 = γ, δ 2 , then going 502 counter-clockwise until the last of the cells in RING α (1) has been labeled 7 (i.e., 503 γ − 1, δ + 1 = γ, δ 7 and moving on to the west most cell in RING α (2) as 8 and so on 504 until all cells in RING α (r) have been labeled.
