The generation interval, defined as the interval between the time when an individual becomes infected and the time when that individual infects another individual (Svensson, 2007) , plays a key role in shaping the relationship between r and R 0 (Wearing et al., 2005; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007; Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Park et al., 2019) ; therefore, estimates of R 0 from different models directly depend on their implicit assumptions about the generation-interval distribution and the exponential growth rate.

The alignment allows to define 5 conserved motifs which are represented in Fig.
As the transgenes are regulated by their endogenous promoters, they had varying levels of expression, as observed by Western blotting (Fig.
For this reason, to improve the accuracy of the prediction, the threshold 0.4 was used.

We omit discussion of these in this paper; while these are a very likely useful way to obtain information as to gating mechanisms, the interpretations are not entirely obvious, and it would take a considerable amount of discussion to consider exactly how these results accord with the various possible gating models; we have not discussed conduction in detail, and some toxins interfere with conduction rather than gating.
