We incorporated smoothed spline functions of time, which accommodate nonlinear and nonmonotonic patterns between mortality and time, thus offering a flexible modeling tool.
The ability to accurately control the ratio of multi-cargo particle loading should enable identification of novel, precise combinations of modulatory signals that lead to diversified and improved T cell behavior.
The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic antiviral effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virushost interactions.

In contrast, mice that mount a weak inflammatory monocyte response exhibit preservation of CA1 neurons and maintain cognitive performance, despite robust virus infection [8] .
If one assumes that most fever causes are affected by social distancing, the declining proportion of SARS-CoV-2 among fever cases may reflect the benefits of interventions aimed specifically at this infection, which is to say case-based interventions like active monitoring, individual quarantine, and isolation.
Read counts per gene (protein-coding genes only) were obtained using HTSeq (Anders et al., 2015) , with a requirement that reads map entirely within the forward strand coding sequence (htseq-count parameters: -m intersection-strict -s yes -t CDS).

Isolation and contact tracing decreased transmission, as shown by a decrease in the effective reproduction number (Figure 3b ).
However, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to investigate the exact antiviral mechanisms, determine potential synergistic effects, and to confirm their antiviral efficacy in an animal model to prioritize and select drugs for potential use in patients affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
For MSTI to be beneficial, one needs to minimize and maximize [9] .
Studying these 'escapees' in 37 aggregate is complicated, however, by the fact that multiple mechanisms can promote apparent 38 escape.
