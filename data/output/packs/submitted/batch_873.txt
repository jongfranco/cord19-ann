Influenza may control a population's susceptibility to other respiratory viruses, blocking their spread because of strong a population-level innate immune response generated by influenza strains during an annual epidemic "flu season".
However, errors in report could also explain this information.
While the deceased patients were significantly older than the survived patients ( Figure   3A ), ages were comparable between men and women in both deceased and survived patients with SARS ( Figure 3B ).

by inhibiting XP expression).
Our estimate of R 0 is lower than most previous published estimates, for example ( 16 ) ( 17 ) ( 8 ) , which have assumed SARS-like generation times; emerging evidence for shorter generation times for COVID-19 results in a smaller R 0 .
In addition to phenotypic change without accompanying, explanatory genetic change, we also repeatedly observed some genetic change without an obvious cause or consequence.
While R is a useful indicator, it is not necessarily constant across geographic regions.

The likelihood function was a function of: the number G of observed clusters with one index case; the number H of observed clusters with more than 1 index cases; the number J of detected index cases not leading to onward transmission; the number of clusters whose index cases have not been identified; and the number of undetected imported cases that did not generate any cluster.
First, genetic deletion of CCR2 in all cells almost entirely abrogates inflammatory monocyte infiltration at 18 hpi but actually increases neutrophil infiltration at this timepoint.

Importantly, EP is efficient across multiple cell lines and treated cells show 144 little or no sign of damage or toxicity ( Figure S1A and D-F).
The terms on the RHS represent: i) no growth event occurs in [t, t + δt); ii) a growth event occurs in the horizontal direction between agents (r x − 1, 0) apart, moving them (r x , 0) apart on a domain of size N x × N y at [t + δt); iii) a growth event occurs in the horizontal direction at a site that is not in between agents (r x , 0) apart, meaning that they remain (r x , 0) apart but now on a domain of size N x × N y at time [t + δt); and iv) a growth event occurs in the vertical direction (as the sites are horizontally colinear in this a GM1 growth event cannot change the distance between them).
