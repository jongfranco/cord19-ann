High-resolution structural studies of coronavirus spike proteins have the potential to shed light on molecular mechanisms of spike prefusion stability and the lessons learned can be utilized in the production of stabilized spike proteins as vaccine immunogens.
14 If these early results hold-up, then the already uncertain transmission reduction benefits from school closures will be reduced relative to influenza.
However, detailed estimates of the full generation interval are difficult to obtain, and the link between uncertainty in the generation interval and uncertainty in estimates of R are often unclear.

Characterizing the r-R relationship with mean and coefficient of variation also helps explain results based on compartmental models [46, 37] , because the mean and variance of the generation interval is linked to the mean and variance of latent and infectious periods.
This work was funded by the Spanish Society of Tropical Medicine and International Health.
Notably, we observed MHV-induced loss of three classes of cells: 1) cells that are not permissive to the virus (CD4 + T cells), 2) cells that are permissive to MHV but do not demonstrate Ly6e KO-dependent infection (NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils), and 3) cells that are permissive to MHV in a Ly6e KO-dependent manner (B cells and DC).
Apart from the lung, ACE2 is also associated with gut function.

Finally, we designed a probe pair for a recently emerging pathogen, SARS-CoV-2.
Of 624 particular concern is the possibility that outbreaks in the reservoir could cause periods of 625 amplified local spillover, which could create a clustering pattern of human cases potentially 626 indistinguishable from human-to-human transmission.
Points in blue represent peptides enriched with pairwise z-scores >10.
This epidemic resulted in over 8,000 infections with a ~10% case fatality rate and was eventually contained through public health measures, as there are no specific treatments approved for human coronavirus infections.
As with the serum, CCL2 was robustly detected at 3 hpi, at levels in excess of 4000 pg per brain, and decreased sharply at 6 hpi ( Figure 2B ).

RT-PCR was carried out according to the manufacturers' instruction.
f map effectively specifies whether p will capture the subsequence at r. Further, CATCH assumes that because p captures an entire fragment and not just the subsequence to which it binds, p "covers" both r and some number of bases (given in θ d ) on each side of r; we term this a "cover extension".
Choosing which viruses should constitute the negative class is application dependent and influences the performance of the trained models.
