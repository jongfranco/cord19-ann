To quantify cytosolic delivery of 1, we made use of a previously reported glucocorticoidinduced eGFP translocation (GIGT) assay (18, 20, 52 ) that couples the cytosolic delivery of a molecule tagged with dexamethasone (Dex) to the nuclear translocation of a reporter protein consisting of a glucocorticoid receptor variant with exceptional affinity for dexamethasone (GR*) (53, 54) fused to eGFP (GR*-eGFP) ( Figure S5A ).
