Interestingly, our simulations predict that IAV bound to slowly-diffusing transmembrane glycoproteins (diffusion coefficient <0.01µm 2 /s) or mucins anchored within a gel (diffusion coefficient <0.0001µm 2 /s) will exhibit persistent directed 35 mobility, while virus bound to more rapidly diffusing species (>0.01µm 2 /s) will not ( Although our results focus on a two-dimensional geometry in which a virus adheres to a flat surface decorated with sialic acid, such as a cell surface, we reasoned that they should generalize to three dimensions, such as secreted mucus through which IAV must penetrate to reach naïve cells to infect.
