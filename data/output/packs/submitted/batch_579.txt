We also include per capita disease-induced and natural mortality rates α and µ, respectively, that accumulate in disease class D, as well as allow for the occurrence of a per capita immunity-waning rate ν ( Figure 1 ).
However, since the epidemic of COVID-19 appeared around the Chinese Spring Festival, the nationwide traffic should be modeled by the traffic network flow, in order to characterize the huge number of population flows in and out all provinces (cities), which formed the flow-SEHIR model in [10] .
The limit of detection of the developed assay was determined in a host DNA background: 1 µl of host (potato) genomic DNA (10 ng µl -1 ) was added in each 10-fold serially diluted genomic DNA of D. dianthicola (A5569) from 10 ng to 1 fg.
Both for generating accurate predictions of epidemic risk and controlling the outbreak, it is vital to begin contact tracing before numerous transmission chains become widely distributed across space [38, 39] Second, viral genome sequences provide information on both the timing of the outbreak [40] [41] [42] and structure of secondary cases [43] [44] [45] .
Those population may carry the COVID-19 for several days and might infect others who are closely contacting with, which makes the potentional risk.

In addition, BMMs deficient in the 216 antiviral effectors RNase L and PKR were not sufficient to restore ExoN(-) viral replication.
Since chronic mucus hypersecretion is associated with long term FEV 1 decline 19 , we also hypothesized that the amplified induction of MUC5AC during RV infection would be related to acute lung function changes during COPD exacerbation.
According to our study, we found that these Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion of COVID-19 are significantly effective and powerful.

Mediation scores were calculated with bootstrapping using the mediate function from the mediation R package (version 4.4.7) (Tingley et al.
When allowed different deme-specific population sizes, the structured coalescent model succeeds because a large proportion of human sequences fall into tightly connected clusters, which informs a low estimate for the population size of the human deme.
The 565 results of this assay supported the previously identified increase in bleomycin resistance of 566 homozygous jmjd-5 deletions in both parental backgrounds ( Figure S11, File S7 , p < 0.05, 567
If every region of the human genome were amplified and sequenced at 0.6 million reads per sample, only one read of viral target would be recovered.
