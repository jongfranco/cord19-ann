The de novo gene 331 product is often an accessory protein and often disordered (26).
The consistent decline of R0 during our study period in both cities could be attributed to the consistent decline of average growth rate, as average incubation period and average infectious period were consistently increasing.
As this probability continues to decline, we use the average (0.37%) of these two values as our model parameter to be cautiously optimistic ( Figure 1D ).

Given aforementioned advantages, we believe that there is a broad range of applications of our siRNA delivery platform.
On examination, this closer agreement is due to the smaller overall variation in generation times in measles: when overall variation is small, differences between distributions have less effect.
This latter phenotype, termed "dominant 40 escape", is particularly notable as it involves a specific RNA element whose presence in the 3' 41 UTR of an mRNA protects against SOX cleavage, regardless of whether the RNA contains a 42 targeting motif (19-21).
