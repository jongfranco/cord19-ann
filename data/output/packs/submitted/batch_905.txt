Even though the pGKL plasmids encode their own putative capping enzyme (K2Orf3p), we found that few pGKL1/2 genes give rise to the frequently 5'-capped transcripts and that most of the transcripts contain a short leader of non-template adenosine nucleotides (1-20) at their 5' ends that could not have been continuously transcribed from the plasmids (Figs.
Importantly, based on random distributions of disordered sequences with an FCR ≈ 0.3 there is a clear evolutionary preference for sequences with higher than randomly expected κ-values ( Figure S1 ).
To test the importance of these sites in cells, a mCherry-Mis12-MAD1 8A mutant with all the sites mutated into alanine was expressed and found to be defective in maintaining the mitotic arrest (229±23 min mitotic duration) (Fig.
During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and challenging problem is to forecast the future trends, like how many individuals might be infected each day, when the epidemics stop spreading, what kinds of policies and actions have to taken and how they influence the epidemics, and so forth [1] [2] [3] [4] Since the accurate epidemic forecast is so critical, there are diverse methods reported in the literature to try to achieve this goal [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .
