In particular, the small lipid-poor particles are the best acceptors of cholesterol from cells and thus should be particularly important in mediating reverse cholesterol transport, whereas larger particles, associated with proteins such as paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and APOE, are likely to be important in protecting against inflammation.

Our in vitro experiments showed that CNO was able to elicit an increase in microglial intracellular calcium concentration, only in hM3Dq-positive cells.
Also, we did not take into account uncertainties associated to the social contact rates estimated from the survey data, as previous work showed their limited impact in fitting serological data [55] .
Second, understanding the possible role of transmission by asymptomatic individuals is crucial to planning surveillance and control efforts [1, 4] .
