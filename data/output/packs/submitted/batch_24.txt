Thus, the predicted effectiveness of the condom intervention will depend strongly on our estimate of the importance of early transmission: if early transmission is low, we expect disease spread to be too strong to be controlled completely by our intervention.
Phospho-Ub-dependent parkin loss does not require canonical mitochondrial parkin activity During mitophagy initiation, PINK1 and parkin participate in a positive feedback loop wherein parkin-mediated poly-ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins provides PINK1 with ubiquitin substrates for phosphorylation, generating phospho-poly-Ub [50] .

3B) show the most dissimilar gene expression profile.
Although the co-localization of these proteins in the nucleus was only suggestive that 334 PARP2 was ubiquitinated, further analysis was necessary to provide conclusive evidence.

In this work, we present the results of fitting a very simple (perhaps even simplistic) model to the available data and a forecast of new infections.
PPARA is activated by endogenous fatty acid metabolite ligands in response to fasting and promotes the uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids by regulating a wide range of genes that reprogram metabolic pathways to facilitate the use of lipids as an energy source.
2) The cleavage sites between 3' sRNAs and their downstream 5' 110 sRNAs are not limited to one (usually three) due to inexact cleavage by enzymes ( Figure 1B) .

Arrows show the most likely source of infection for each case infected up to that point in time over 1,000 sampled transmission trees, and are coloured by the type of infection source and shaded according to the proportion of trees in which that individual was the most likely infector (darker shading indicating a higher proportion).
