Because IL6 and Aβ were independently observed to reduce free water relative to nTg controls, we predict that both proteins may be inducing an increase in glial cells in WM and hippocampal areas.
The calculated section is voltage dependent, while this intracellular section is expected to have little direct voltage dependence, although it would shift protons depending on the state of the channel because of the change in protonation of the residues above it, which do respond to voltage shifts, in a sort of domino cascade.
Additionally, larger BAG was associated with worse cognitive performance, indicating that this .

Together these results suggest amplicon sequencing was not as accurate as 206 capture sequencing in identifying minor alleles, which could be in part due to Matthew effect 207 caused by PCR.
In the multivariable analysis, similarly, being quarantined 216 (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80-3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 217 95% CI 1.96-2.49) were two strong significant determinants of treatment-seeking in 218 the hospital.
