It was often necessary to perform two centrifugation steps, 362 transferring the soluble fraction to a new tube in between steps, to remove all the precipitate.
When we use Gaussian distribution to simulate, the main influence is the average value, but the standard deviation has little influence, so we will take the best accord with the objective fact variance to simulate.

This assumption may be appropriate for certain acute viral infection types where host immunity does not play a significant role, however, chronic infections with wider persistent circulation of multiple subtypes increase the chances to misinterpret the transmission process.
