When cells are grown at high temperature, double-stranded forms (known as W for ScNV-20S and T for ScNV-23S) accumulate, but these appear to represent by-products and not replication intermediates (Wesolowski and Wickner 1984; Rodrıǵuez-Cousiño et al.
For example, we expect the speed-based framework to be clearer for characterizing newly invading pathogens: when an epidemic is growing exponentially, the reproductive number cannot be estimated with confidence (Weitz and Dushoff, 2015) , especially when there is large uncertainty in the shape of the generation-interval distribution (Park et al., 2020) .
