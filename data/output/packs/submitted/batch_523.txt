which stated that the insertions are located on the interface with ACE2.
392 However, considering that LDs have been proposed to play a significant role in the 393 replication cycle of rotaviruses, it remains possible that the protein transport between the ER 394 membrane and LDs is needed for the correct processing of both VP7 (glycosylation 395 independent) and NSP4.

At some positions single nucleotide 647 resolution for the chimaeric break-point could not be established; where reads were 648 found to break at adjacent possible positions these positions were merged to give a 649 short region containing the breakpoint.
As a result of the extensive contacts with both strands, it is possible that the assignment of guide and tracking strands within remodelling ATPases is not absolute as tracking may be coupled to both strands.
They may either overestimate or underestimate the real situation of a epidemic in an unpredictable way.
