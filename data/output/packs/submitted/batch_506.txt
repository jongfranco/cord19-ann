Apoa2 and Saa2 exhibited much more significant pQTL than eQTL (P=1.324e-22, effect size = -0.413 vs. P=1.276e-4, effect size = 0.0210 for Apoa2, and P=2.559e-10, effect size = 0.0780 and P=1.533e-6, effect size = 0.780 for Saa2 respectively), suggesting that the pQTL were due to coding rather than regulatory variations.
However, it is worth noting that a number of identified cases have died (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 2020) and that the true case fatality rate has yet to be estimated accurately.
Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 due to its ease of use and high sensitivity.

Rather, it means the overall changes in cumulative incidence in these provinces were not only driven by imported cases but also infected cases through local transmissions.
The RaptorX server used the templates for generating the 3D structures of the query vaccine constructs [177] .
The quarantine-all policy has very effectively reduced the total number of disease cases but has vastly increased the burdens of quarantine and isolation.
Note that we did not have data for 129 railroad and other forms of transport, and thus made an assumption that the total number of travelers is 4 times 130 higher than that of air transport except for certain cities on Hainan island that have no road connections to 131 Wuhan.
