One possible explanation we cannot rule out is that some feature of the nascent peptide engenders pausing through interactions with the ribosome exit tunnel or chaperones; clusters of positively-charged amino acid residues have been documented to induce ribosome pausing (Ingolia, 2014; Sabi and Tuller, 2017) , although such clusters are not evident upstream of the pause sites seen here.
