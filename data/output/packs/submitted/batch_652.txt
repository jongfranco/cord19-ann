These determinants include monogenic effectors, such rare homozygous mutations in ABCA1, LCAT, and APOA1 causing extremely low HDL-C (Brooks-Wilson et al., 1999; Kuivenhoven et al., 1996; Ng et al., 1994) , and rare homozygous mutations in CETP, LIPC, and SCARB1, causing extremely elevated HDL-C .
We assume that at time t after 23 January, an increasing control function u(t) represents the fraction of the transmissions that are prevented, thus the effective reproduction number becomes R(t) = (1 − u(t))R 0 S(t)/N.
Although our analysis was based on the COVID-19 outbreak in China, our findings could provide insight into the public health measures in other areas of the world, considering the outbreak occurs in city with a relatively high population mobility (e.g., London, New York, and Tokyo), and the virus could spread to the province/state where this city is located and even the entire country quickly.
