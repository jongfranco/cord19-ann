Instead, the participants could choose themselves when to run the app which might have biased some to choose a particularly 'interesting' day when they are going to meet a lot of people, or travel somewhere unusual.
Moreover, the latent population prevalence θ t " pθ S t , θ I t , θ R t q J is a three-dimensional Markov process, in which θ S t is the probability of a person being susceptible or at risk at time t, θ I t is the probability of a person being infected at time t, and θ R t is the probability of a person being removed from the infectious system (either recovered or dead) at time t. Obviously, θ S t`θ I t`θ R t " 1.
