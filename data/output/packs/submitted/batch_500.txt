Furthermore, travelers to these provinces were more likely to be tourists as opposed to returning home; therefore, they have little social ties to the local population and are less likely to introduce widespread local transmissions.

Here, y is the number of cumulative confirmed cases by February 27 of each non-Wuhan region, x1 is the sum number of immigrants from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 of each non-Wuhan region, and x2 is the number of cumulative confirmed cases by January 29 of each non-Wuhan region.
As a gatekeeper in the metabolic degradation of glucose, PFK is highly regulated, both by downstream metabolites and its strong allosteric activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), which is produced by PFKFB when glycolysis is upregulated (Warburg effect) (68) .
By contrast, the Wuhan respondents were significantly more often confused about the reliability of the information that they received (p=0.003); only 31% respondents in Wuhan never felt bothered about this issue, while the corresponding figure in Shanghai was 42.9%.
We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China.

The MuLBSTA score, an efficient early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia 30 , needs further validation in the future practice.
Together, our data demonstrates that the coronavirus receptors tend to share co-expression pattern across different tissues, consistent with the fact that CoVs infect similar types of cells and CoV-infected patients share similar clinical symptoms.
The results of this analysis showed that these proteins were expressed at a significantly higher level in monocytes compared to all other phenotypes (p<0.0001).
Our main model therefore assumes a Brownian motion model of evolution [62] .
