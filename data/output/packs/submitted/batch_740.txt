From 20 to 79 independent clones were sequenced and analyzed for each ORF.
In the ecological population dynamics, each host strain i has abundance N i (the carrying capacity of all strains is K) and reproduces at a per-capita rate of r. Each viral strain j has abundance V j , which increases due to infection and lysis of hosts and decays at a density-independent rate m. Extinction of any host or viral strain occurs when these fall below a critical threshold ρ c .

total voxels in the specific range divided by the total number of voxels of the ROI mask).
They found that the bacterial MAGs that were present in the donor samples and also colonized the recipient samples after FMT mostly belonged to the order Bacteroidales.
In peptide-centric assays, commonly called "bottom-up" or "shotgun" proteomics, proteins are subjected to proteolytic cleavage to produce smaller peptide sequences prior to LCMS, often using chemically modified trypsin.
A second binomial test is performed on the shared (indistinguishable) peptide alignments.
One possibility would be that these nsp16-like were bi-functional, carrying both 2'-O and N7guanine methylation activity such as evidenced in Flavivirus NS5 protein, with no obvious signature sequence of this bi-functionality.
