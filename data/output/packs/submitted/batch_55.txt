We hypothesize that since samples WT and SL2 were obtained from non-plaque-purified serially passaged virus populations derived from in vitro-transcribed genome RNAs transfected into Huh-7 cells, differences in the proportion of full-length transcripts versus abortive transcripts could translate into different patterns of recombination.

However, as shown by the CCoV/FCoV serotype 131 highlighting, the complete genome-based phylogenetic tree fails to cluster CCoV and FCoV strains 132 according to serotype demarcations, and instead groups strains according to their host species.
The similarity of two sequences is then simply defined as follows:
FRODA continues each run until a user-defined maximum number of steps (in this case 1500) or until "jamming" occurs where the constraints can no longer be satisfied, typically when the motion has led to severe steric clashes through the collision of two domains.
