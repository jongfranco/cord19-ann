In total, we analyzed 43,134 cells derived from normal lung tissue of To further understand the special population of ACE2-expressing AT2, we performed gene ontology enrichment analysis to study which biological processes are involved with this cell population by comparing them with the AT2 cells not expressing ACE2.
Using exactly the same parameters and seeding the infection in the same initial wards resulted in a difference in peak timing of +/-10 days (figure 2).
Most notably, there was a negligible AD-2 site 1 response elicited by 168 vaccination, which is known to be a target of potent gB-specific neutralizing antibodies (42) (AD-169 2 site 1 median log 10 MFI: gB/MF59=2.68, SP=3.69; p<0.001, Saittertherwaite t test).

Let the transmission probability be β and the contact rate be c. With contact tracing, we assume a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined, and can either move to the compartment B or S q at a rate of βcq or (1 -β)cq), depending on whether they are infected or not, while the other proportion, 1 -q, consists of individuals exposed to the virus who are missed from contact tracing and move to the exposed compartment E at a rate of βc(1 − q)
The reduced toxicity could not be attributed to changes in complement activation, blood hemolysis, or anaphylactic responses mediated by histamine.
