Obviously, the incubation period can be introduced from Shanghai, while C 0 and C 1 should be approximated by real data.
4 However, such study of the incubation period can be highly influenced by the individuals' recall bias or interviewers' judgement on the possible dates of exposure rather than the actual dates of exposure that, in turn, might not be accurately monitored and determined, thus leading to a high percentage of error.
From March 17, 2020, E would be < 5 and, a week later on
236 We refer to the second method as the individual-level method because it relies on indi- whereas changes due to spatial or network structure reflect the dynamics of the outbreak.
