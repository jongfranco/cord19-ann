Sequence-intrinsic conformational preferences of CTT sequences are influenced by the extent of charge segregation: We performed atomistic simulations of the WT CTT from B. subtilis FtsZ and the six designed variants.
Thus, PBCA clearly induced redox imbalance, and this seemed to trigger the downstream stress responses, as treatment with excess GSH prevented PBCA-induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, phosphorylation of eIF2α, and accumulation of ATF4 ( Figure 3C -F).
926 although the genetic variation within colonies is high, variation across the different colonies is 927 expected to be low.
