We defined X n+1 to be an outlier if the probability of observing this point given observations X 1 , X 2 .
Moreover, considering the high sequence identity between viral proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, seeking protease inhibitors to treat respiratory diseases induced by SARS and this novel pneumonia will be our first choice.
However, the probability of developing symptoms mid-flight increases with flight time and hence exit screening is more effective for longer flights (Figure 2 ).

15, 29 The strong support for this policy offers a great opportunity to improve regulations on wet markets and change the prevalent habit of eating wild animal products in China.
Next, we consider a "test-and-treat" strategy in which infected individuals are identified, linked to care and receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) with the goal of both preserving health and preventing transmission through viral suppression.

The 26 distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the 27 evolution of the MHC system in the bear family.
Basic model 98 The DICE package has been designed to implement meta-population epidemic modeling 99 on an arbitrary spatial scale with or without coupling between the regions.
Rather than solving for complete generality, we note that we want the slowest decaying mode for which c is finite at r=0 (eliminating cosines), and has a no-flux boundary condition at the sphere's radius R. No flux at R implies ∂c/∂r = 0, which implies that ∂u/∂r·(1/u) = 1/r at r = R. Therefore, k·cos(k·R)/sin(k·R) = 1/R, i.e.

In contrast to the mobility-driven strategies that change the population's mobility patterns, other solutions such as hand washing appear to be more cost-and reward-effective.
To test whether this 137 was also the case for our novel candidate SRE-bearing transcripts, we monitored cleavage 138 upon expression of the nsp1 protein from SARS coronavirus.

The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea (from 31 cases on 18 February to 2,022 cases on 28 February) and Italy (from 20 cases on 21 February to 650 cases on 28 February), shows how missed infectious subjects may cause rapid transmission within a very short period, due to the combination of a short serial interval and an occasionally high reproduction number [24] .
