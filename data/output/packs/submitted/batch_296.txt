A third reason is that much of the phylogenetic research done so far has relied on phylogenetic protocols (43-48), which have evolved to become a standard to which it seems sensible to adhere.
Using a relatively large sample of post-stroke individuals, we were able to evaluate brain damage associated with paraphasias made during connected speech and naming and, in a sample of individuals who had scores on both a naming assessment and a connected speech assessment, compare the distribution of paraphasias across the tasks.

Indeed, rotation allows cells to "scan" the environment, and veer to the light source direction when stimulated (or escape in the opposite direction, when the signal is too strong).

Furthermore, in the previous section, we highlighted some limitations in the standard formulation of deterministic models to account for the specific phenomena of population 'fade-out' (or spontaneous transmission interruption) which are present in the real world due to chance effects in population growth and decay especially when host population densities are low.
