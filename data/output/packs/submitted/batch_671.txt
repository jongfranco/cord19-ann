The greedy algorithm continues selecting among the candidate probes until it obtains the desired partial coverage of each universe (target sequence).
The resulting strains display K1 killer and immunity phenotypes at the permissive temperature (24°C) (Fig.
This notion is further reflected in terms of glycosylation, with all of the glycan sites conserved on the S2 subunit between SARS and 2019-nCoV, whereas the S1 subunit exhibits glycan site additions and deletions (SI Fig.
