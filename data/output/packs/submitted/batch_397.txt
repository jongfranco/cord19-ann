There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy: (1) the number of confirmed cases may be showing the variability as it has in the past, and the current numbers are not capturing the actual situation, or (2) the pandemic is indeed slowing down but it will take a while (perhaps a week) for that to show up in the fatality data.
