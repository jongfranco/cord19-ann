Narrower and more peaked distributions than Poisson expectation indicated a more regular than random distribution, with many swab samples containing a similar number of species, providing indirect evidence of mutual repulsion in competition.
In support of this, we reconstructed maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining phylogenies using full-length RBD protein sequences, and both showed that SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV were grouped in the same clade, with relatively high support, which is consistent with two previous studies 6,7 , at the same time, their phylogenetic intermediates were clustered in distinct clades (Fig.
