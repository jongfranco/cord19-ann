Therefore, it remains critical to apply a fast and convenient detection method to distinguish and trace suspicious case or contacts as early as possible in order to prevent super-transmission events.
We expect that this trend will continue, especially as testing becomes more readily available in new countries.

While the factors supporting virus 'overwintering' are still unclear, it is plausible that Zika virus may have survived low mosquito abundance through a combination of low level mosquito-to-human transmission, vertical transmission in mosquitoes (da Costa et al., 2018; Thangamani et al., 2016) , and, to a lesser extend, human sexual transmission (Althaus and Low, 2016).
