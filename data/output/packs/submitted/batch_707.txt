The threshold for admitting patients and for monitoring in the hospital was likely lower than for other respiratory infections because of uncertainty about the clinical course of COVID-19.
Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus).
Many healthcare workers must reduce time spent providing patient care, running diagnostic tests, and tracing contacts, and increase time caring for their own children.
Experiments were carried out according to European and French national institutional animal care guidelines (protocol APAFIS#2016012909576100).

In the Table 1 , we use two kind of quarantine strategies introduced below.
While this strategy is a proof-of-concept and will require further testing using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and validation in animal models before clinical tests in humans, it represents a unique approach to implement a rapid and broad antiviral defense in humans against emerging pathogens for which there are no effective vaccines.
At present, the epidemic situation in South Korea is basically under control.
Of course, we hope the latter is the case, but are not entirely confident considering the history of the reporting problems concerning this pandemic.
Protease inhibitors are remarkably effective in blocking the replication of coronavirus, including the SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), providing a promising foundation for the development of anticoronaviral therapeutics.
The same phenomenon was observed when the FASTA pairwise alignment was plotted in the color-coded matrix (Fig 3) .

For a specific coding sequence, the 2 BS-REL test estimates the proportion of codons where the rate of non-synonymous 3 substitutions is higher than the rate of synonymous substitutions (dN/dS>1), which is a 4 hallmark of adaptive evolution.
We grouped patients into severe and non-severe 2019-nCoV ARD .
Furthermore, patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were stratified for severe illness incidence with respect to age with NLR (strata 1: age < 50 years and NLR < 3.13; strata 2: age < 50 years and NLR ≥ 3.13; strata 3: age ≥ 50 years and NLR < 3.13; strata 4: age ≥ 50 years and NLR ≥ 3.13).
22 In such a context of increasing availability of data, it is of utmost practical 23 importance to build databases of miRNA expressions data for cancer research [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , 24 and also to extract features that could be used as cancer biomarkers [20] [21] [22] .
In these cases, long-read (LR) sequencing technologies are invaluable because they can sequence entire molecules in one pass and thus capture long-range connectivity of complex isoforms.
There can be a delay to symptom appearance resulting from the incubation period and delay to confirmation of cases resulting from detection and testing capacity (9) .

We then compute the shortest steps between any city to Wuhan, deriving the variable social distances for city as ∈ (1, 8) .
The highlights of findings are: (1) most deaths occurred in patients 70 years of age or older; (2) male patients had a mortality significantly higher than females (3 times); (3) no death occurred in patients 30 years of age or younger.
To make the model accord with reality, contrast with the standard SEIR model, we added two parameters Δ(t) and θ(t).

The duration of the expression of tTA-dependent proteins is determined by the time course of induction and the stability of cFos-tTA-dependent transcripts and proteins in tagged neurons.
However, it must be noted that the MAX and WT proteases have similar RNA folding 244 free energy (10).
Overall, the resulting maximum error rate amounts to 3 x 10 -4 or 1 SNP every 3,312 cloned nucleotides.
However, substrate binding is inaccessible in this conformation and consequently, the protein lacks chaperone activity [13] .
In developing a stochastic formulation we use the notationX

We demonstrated, through near surface-saturated biomolecule loading and precise ratiometric control of moiety loading, that hybridization-based thermodynamics can overcome limitations of traditional surface conjugation such as reduced efficiency of multi-step reactions, steric hindrance, and decay of functional groups.
Moreover, these studies employed buffers that lacked small monovalent ions (Adam et al., 2015; , conditions known to favor extension of disordered domains owing to reduced electrostatic screening (Srinivasan et al., 2014) .

Approximating the marginal likelihood is a task both difficult and time-consuming.
Samples were 406 subjected to 12 or 17.5% SDS-PAGE and silver stained (GE, Boston, MA).
If a patient has extensive social activities before the symptom onset, the risk of transmission will be greatly increased.
Therefore, one analytical challenge (among many) is to take that collection of sequences (likely numbering in the millions) and accurately determine what species are present in the sample.
Additionally, we also obtained travel-associated Zika virus case data from Europe, where the travel policies to Cuba to the best of our knowledge have not recently changed.
To explore potential intermediate host of a novel coronavirus is vital to rapidly control 2 continuous COVID-19 spread.
