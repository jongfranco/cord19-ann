Collectively, these data suggest that while there 297 is some overlap between the sequence, structure, and RNA binding proteins associated 298 with the GADD45B and IL-6 SREs, these elements likely assemble distinct RNP complexes 299 and thus may function in a related but non-identical manner.
As MERS-CoV is a Risk Group 3 agent that needs to be handled in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) setting, we employed a viral pseudotyping technique to generate pseudo-particles (PP) that serve as surrogates of native virions and are suitable for infection in a BSL-2 setting.
