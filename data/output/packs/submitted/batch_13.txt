In the following system, N indicates the total cell capacity of the area modeled: To solve for R0, we adopted a next generation matrix approach, after Heffernan, Smith, and Wahl 2005, which we applied to the proportional system of equations (1-5, above).
However, a conducted Granger causality test was significant suggesting that in the absence of a more likely explanation the peak seen in the ePCR data is most likely caused by influenza cases.
