Compare with stable group, patients in progressive group were significantly older (P = 0.001), but the male gender and imported proportions were not shown statistical difference.
Clearly, our re-interpretation already highlights a striking result: Higher moments of the distribution of secondary cases can lead a disease with a lower R 0 to more easily invade a population and to reach a larger final outbreak size than a disease with a higher R 0 .
In this 31 respect, it is particularly intriguing that VIPs have experienced highly increased rates of 32 adaptation within host functions such as development or neurogenesis (Table S3) .

Supplementary 2f) were synthesized and incorporated into particle emulsion with reaction mixtures at different ratios (3:1:1, 1:1:1 and 1:1:3).
23 More ambiguity arises in the estimation of the mean generation time because actual 24 data often concern the onset of clinical symptoms rather than the time of infection.
Our model also accounts for the effect of control measures on disease transmission.
