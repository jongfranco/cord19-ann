Not being diagnosed can be a consequence of not developing symptoms, having only mild symptoms, or any other reason why infected persons might not be identified by health care.
Alternatively viroporin activity may be mediated by a small, basic double-525 transmembrane protein, the ORF of which is embedded within the EToV N gene in 526 the +1 frame (with respect to N).
Cdc6 traces of mean nuclear intensity were scored as follows: Cdc6 peak time: frame with highest nuclear Cdc6 intensity before the sharp drop in intensity indicating export to the cytoplasm.
Incubation period is very important but very difficult to be estimated, since it is difficult to know when the patients were infected.
We call for particular attentions on 1) the proper use and cleaning of toilets (e.g.
