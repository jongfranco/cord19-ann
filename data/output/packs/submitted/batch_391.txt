Consistent with the label-free analysis, we found several known interactors, most of them reproducibly enriched (Fig.
between an exponentially decaying spatial kernel and a Cauchy-type kernel in our previous study (1) (the exponential kernel 73 gave a marginally better fit), we use the exponential kernel here: and asymptomatic individuals, we take the relative infectiousness of pre-symptomatic individuals, h0, to be the same as that of 93 asymptomatic individuals (i.e.
Likewise, the genes were also divided into five clusters labelled G1-G5.
