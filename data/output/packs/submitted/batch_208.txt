A majority of studies have strictly focused on modeling the reporting delay distribution-a legacy of the actuarial techniques giving rise to many of these approaches-and generally neglect a key feature of outbreaks: that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases, a fact that creates potentially strong autocorrelation in the true number of cases over short time intervals.
