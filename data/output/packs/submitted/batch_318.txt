Total lymphocyte number was decreased in severe patients but not in mild patients, suggesting the lymphopenia severe patients ( Figure 1B ).
As shown in Figure 6 , the quarantine-all policy eliminates opportunities for further pathogen transmission; however, it also results in the quarantine of healthy individuals who have not been exposed, contributing to immense productivity losses, extreme logistic burdens associated with providing accommodations for an entire population, and acute civil rights concerns.
In trials with more communities or increased heterogeneity, the bias from heterogeneity in hazard rates will likely be more pronounced (16) .
