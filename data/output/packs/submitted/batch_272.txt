the basic reproduction number.
The motivation for this representation is to employ a sufficiently realistic epidemiology model to describe the transmission relationships of interest and use existing methods for modeling viral evolution by mapping them to the epidemiology model.
Because of its small size (967 amino acids), high specificity, and strong catalytic activity, we chose Cas13d rather than other Cas13 proteins to target and destroy RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus (IAV) [10] [11] [12] .
