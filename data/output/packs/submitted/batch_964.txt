However, we cannot formally 484 rule out other possible explanations including the possibility that the specific 485 enrichment of translation factors on NS1/2 occurs because NS1/2 is the first protein 486 to be translated from ORF1, therefore unprocessed NS1/2 at the N-terminus of the 487 ORF1 polyprotein being actively translated could function as an anchor, facilitating 488 the enrichment of ribosomes and the associated factors.
