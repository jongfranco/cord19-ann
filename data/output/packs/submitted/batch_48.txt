, k such that c (v, i) = i for v ∈ V and 1 ≤ i ≤ k. We assign zero node weights and unit edge weights for all nodes and edges in H. Now, any assignment in H corresponds to a k-node induced subgraph in G, and the weight of the assignment equals the number of edges in the node-induced subgraph; to this end, an assignment of weight k 2 would correspond to a k-clique in G.
