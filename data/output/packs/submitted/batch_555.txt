In order to obtain the phase diagram in the [C, f ] plane of the BWYV PK, we performed a series of low friction Langevin dynamics simulations by varying the salt concentration from 5 to 1200 mM and the mechanical force from 0 to 20 pN, at a constant temperature of 50 • C. We varied C by changing the Debye length in the simulations, and the mechanical force was externally applied to the terminal nucleotides ( Fig.
