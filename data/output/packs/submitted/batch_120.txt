The threshold of secondary cases that can occur before endemic transmission is possible depends on the dispersion parameter.
Because not all organisms evolve in the same manner (differences in mutation rate, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, etc), the suitability of a database and method to detect a given organism can only be determined by thorough validation and benchmarking, as well as updating the reference database as needed.
