For each case , if the log-254 likelihood was worse than , the connection between the case and its index was removed and the 255 .
The pathogen is then endemic in the reservoir and the In this paper, we have argued that the conventional way for modelling the epidemiological dynamics of endemic pathogens in an incidental host should be enhanced to account for spillover transmission in addition to conspecifics transmission.
