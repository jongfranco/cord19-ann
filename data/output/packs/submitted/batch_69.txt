Another, and perhaps the most likely, explanation why K2Orf3p does not complement the mRNA capping machinery in yeast temperature-sensitive mutants is based on the recent observation that expression of AT-rich pGKL genes in yeast nuclei does not lead to functional products due to the frequent premature 3' polyadenylation of the resulting mRNAs (67) .
