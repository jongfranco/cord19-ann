Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that R 0 for MERS-CoV circulating in humans is much lower than the epidemic threshold of 1.0 and that correspondingly the virus has been introduced into humans hundreds of times.
Given that the effects of public health interventions will usually lag by a period of time, it is important to make adjustment on corresponding measures as soon as the epidemic changes.

Consequently, Scenario 2, which was fully dependent on the growth rate of exported cases, could have overestimated the intrinsic growth rate of cases.
Endothelial cells were also reported to be ACE2 positive.
Although a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out of the city was seen 2 days before LNY's day.
the transmission process in the same way and (ii) case counting is decoupled from the quarantine process (see App.
Thus, the transmission would be so minimal that it would not substantially contribute to the final number of infections, even if there existed a second zoonotic source.
Population ageing is currently more pronounced in wealthier countries, which mercifully may lessen the impact of this pandemic on poorer countries with weaker health systems but younger age structures.
