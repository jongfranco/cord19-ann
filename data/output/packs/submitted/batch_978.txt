Since the concentration of sialic acid within a binding radius is high relative to the Km for NA (>10 mM versus 100µM-1mM (Benton et al., 2015) ), the probability of an NA-SA pair resulting in 40 cleavage is determined from the catalytic rate constant (kcat ~ 100s -1 ) as: ≈ Using these three probabilities, we calculate at each instant in time the number and location of each point of attachment between the virus and the surface and we remove any cleaved sialic All rights reserved.

All the close contacts with COVID-19 cases are required to be isolated in China.
In fact, in some of these works, the models are fitted to reproduce exactly the reported number of infected individuals, which, as noted before, can be counterproductive given that the actual number of infected individuals in the population is surely higher than those detected either by clinical diagnosis or in the laboratory.

The sequence identity is defined as the percentage of characters that match exactly between two different sequences.
Among those models containing flows, undirected models, which assumed that flows increased contact rates in both source and destination states, fit best, and directed models, which assumed that flows increased contact of susceptible farms in the destination state to infective farms in the origin state, fit worst (Table 3) .
