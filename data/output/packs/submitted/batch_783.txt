Symptomatic disease is frequently associated with transmissibility of a pathogen.
In NP-mediated drug delivery, cellular stress pathways that are induced as a response to the nanocarrier itself may be beneficial if these stress responses sensitize the target cells.
In the latter case, the high replication rate, coupled with the low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses, results in a group of different but related strains infecting the same host, which is often termed as "quasispecies" (Nowak, 2006) .
