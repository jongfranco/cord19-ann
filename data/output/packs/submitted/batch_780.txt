The extrinsic growth rate does not steadily decline but increases to a maximum (i.e., saturation) before steadily declining to zero.
However, because of the extreme heterogeneity in contacts between individuals and the stochastic nature of transmission, we would still expect 15% of all primary cases to generate at least one secondary case that cannot be identified.
The weekly number of confirmed and suspected Zika cases within each country is reported to the Pan American Health Organization.
of "no substitution" at any position if one read matches the 2019-nCoV genome.
The symptoms of chest distress and chest pain were less common in the secondary epidemic area than in the main epidemic area; this may be related to the rapid diagnosis in the secondary epidemic area and early treatment and intervention.
In scenario 3 (Figure 7 .c), many cites have much larger number of infections than scenario 1 (Figure 7 .a) and 2 (Figure 7 .b), suggesting that work resuming will bring large challenge to control the disease timely.

Although no interaction between these two proteins was detected when incubated at 4 C, we observed the appearance of a heterodimeric complex when these proteins were incubated at 37 C ( Figure 2B ) indicating that addition of energy was required for this heterocomplex to form.
In 2019, a large number of individuals moved right before the Spring Festival.
Importantly, most studies on the membrane shaping behavior of BAR domains have examined the BAR domain in isolation, with significant portions of the protein removed.
However, since IGF-1R is not the sole protein interacting with LecB in keratinocytes, we speculate that this "targeting by degradation" strategy can be valid for other membrane receptors as well (e.g., EGF-1R) and that it can be employed by P. aeruginosa to silence host cell receptors to favour tissue colonisation in wounds.
* indicates that the 95% interval extends out of the plotting region.
This will also serve as an ongoing resource as new data becomes available and as the epidemic evolves.
The percentage of patients with MTB infection was also considerably higher than the percentage of patients with other co-morbidities (diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%; Table 1 ), suggesting MTB infection represents a higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
