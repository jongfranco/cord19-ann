The formation of these 515 structures removes excess membrane, which, along with the pressure generated by the 516 AgNPs that adhere onto the membrane, increases the membrane tension and can lead to 517 membrane poration 46 .
Similarly, sharp changes in N (t) could evidence the historical impact of a public health policy (e.g.
And it takes considerable efforts for us to modify their codes for our inputs.
Sequencing low-titre viruses directly from clinical samples is challenging, which is further 238 exacerbated by the fact that coronavirus genomes are the largest among RNA viruses (~3 239 fold larger compared with ZIKV).
The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients.
183 Because infection is monitored by eGFP, which requires virus entry, genome replication, and 184 genome translation, interference with any of these steps would lead to a reduction in the number 185 of eGFP-positive cells.

This way, smaller degrees of seasonal forcing translated into smaller summertime declines in R0; for the no-seasonality scenario, R0 was therefore held fixed at its maximal wintertime value.
Briefly, the index ranges from 0 to 100, with the maximum 100 representing perfect nestedness.
This might explain the superior 314 transduction efficiency of 1918 IAV pseudoparticles (see above), since an increased 315 fusion pH enables earlier endosomal escape and more efficient infection (28).

To identify if DNA reads assigned to Leptospiraceae were more similar to sequence reads of previously identified pathogenic, intermediate or environmental Leptospira species, we built a neighbour-joining tree of Leptospiraceae reads classified in our samples data, together with sequences from reference databases (Figure 3d ; species names and NCBI accession numbers in clockwise rotation around the tree in Supplementary Table 7a ).
All individual-level covariates were transformed into pair-level covariates for analysis (Table 3) .
The classic linear view of HDL genesis from discoidal, lipid-poor nascent particles to spherical, cholesterol-and phospholipid-rich particles packed with a combination of over 100 different proteins has been recently challenged by the finding that HDL is secreted directly from hepatocytes in 4 distinct sizes, with little interchange between them, and representing all of the plasma HDL subparticle pools (Mendivil et al., 2016) .
Evidently, the structural features are different between the commuting network and the air transportation network.
