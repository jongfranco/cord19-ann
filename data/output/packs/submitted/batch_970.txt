The results were analyzed by BIAevaluation software to determine the affinity constant.
The number of days an individual is under quarantine or active monitoring is measured as the time difference between when an individual is identified via contact tracing and when symptoms prompt isolation -which is immediate for an individual under quarantine and determined by the frequency of monitoring for an individual under active monitoring.
In summary, we find that one of the key features of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province but also in all other provinces is the robust sub-exponential rise in the number of confirmed cases according to the scaling law t µ during the first episode of the epidemic.
