However, the understanding of the structural mechanisms underlying the development of these diseases have already served with potential therapeutic options.
Consistent with previous findings, we observed that glycoprotein is a major determinant of SERINC5 sensitivity.
Including imported cases with missing information through imputation, we found the same trend though smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant (delay from travel to hospitalization 9.8 ± 1.2 vs. 8.3 ± 0.5 days p= 0.3; delay from travel to onset 5.8 ±1.1 vs. 4.2 ±0.5 p= 0.16, for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions, respectively).

The doubling time is the time needed to duplicate the number of infected subjects.
The public health implication of our study was that proper triage of patients should be implemented in out-patient clinics or on hospital admission by carefully inquiring the medical history because this will help identify patients who would be more likely to develop serious adverse outcomes during the progression of COVID-19.
The biocompatibility of the scintillator crystal was assessed by implanting a rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystal (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 1.0−1.5 mm) over the VTA using a metal guide tube (inner diameter: 0.5 mm) with a movable metal plunger.
