Thus, identification of ferroptosis-inducing NPs is of considerable interest.
The bias for a model that always over-predicts is therefore 1.
Specifically, in 274 considering the sex-combined dataset for D1 locomotor activity during initial preference for the 275 PF-paired side (5 weeks after the beginning of cuprizone treatment or i.e., three weeks after the 276 termination of cuprizone treatment), there was no effect of Substrain or interaction with Treatment 277 We previously reported a BE-induced downregulation of a gene network enriched for 291 myelinationan effect that was driven by the BE-prone B6NJ substrain (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) .
