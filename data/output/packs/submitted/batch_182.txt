Phenotyping occurred "pre-drug" (7 days before pellet implantation), after "acute drug" treatment (on day 4; one day after split pellet implantation), and chronic treatment with haloperidol or placebo ("chronic drug": 28-35 days after pellet implantation).
In fact, when we 425 looked at the correlation between IFITM3+ and GFP+ cells we saw a 426 significant inverse correlation between these levels (R 2 =0.4730, p=0.0046) 427 .
In addition to the timing of treatment, it is also important to master the treatment duration and choose appropriate corticosteroid formulations and dosage.

The bonding links of the PFR cross section centered at r p (s) are attached to three adjacent MTs at the same MTs' arc length s. The individual attachments are therefore located on the material section of the Ax at s. Given this, g 2 (s) is imposed to be parallel to ∂ φ C(s, φ p ), the tangent vector to the material section of the Ax at the point of contact C(s, φ p ), see Figure 4 .
Permutation of recombining loci will produce a distribution skewed towards more positive values for these two LD statistics and the percentile of the actual observed value can then be used to assess significance.
