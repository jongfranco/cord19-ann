This result is fascinating because the in vivo systemic toxicity response to unmodified chitosan is not identical to the response to unmodified PEI.
This phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and viruses.
In this model, individuals are classified according to their health status: susceptible (S) if they are susceptible to catch the disease; exposed (E) if they have been infected but are still asymptomatic and cannot infect other individuals; infected (I) once the incubation period is over and the individuals show symptoms and could infect others, and removed (R) when they are either recovered or deceased.
