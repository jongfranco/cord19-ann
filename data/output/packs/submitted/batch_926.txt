After the cosmetic had remained on the skin for 40 min, it was washed with cosmetic remover and strikingly, the skin temperature remained depressed by ≈ 0.8 C. This semi-permanent depression of skin temperature likely reflects the presence of residual solid-state brightener specified as an active ingredient in the product's marketing.
This is done by splitting the maps into several 64 # big cubes.
