Since the outbreak scale in the Province of Shanxi was relatively small and this is subject to stochasticity in both case importation and local cases generated by the importation and since the Provincial data has detailed information on symptom onset and serial intervals, we adopt a method developed by Nishiura and Chowell [15, 16] to estimate the effective reproduction number, and we revise some of our early deterministic models to a novel discrete stochastic model to address the key issues relevant to preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19 in other provinces except for Hubei, due to the anticipated gradually relaxing of travel restriction and returning to normal social and economic activities.

Fourth, therapeutic approaches for cases known to be coinfected both SARS-CoV-2 and MTB should bear their MTB infection history in mind; for example, treatments involving immunosuppressive agents should be reconsidered, as they hold the potential to reactivate latent TB infections.
Specifically, the speed of virus escape ultimately depends on the effective rate of mutation per protospacer, which increases linearly with the product of burst size and the mutation rate parameter µ and decreases inversely with the number of protospacers.
