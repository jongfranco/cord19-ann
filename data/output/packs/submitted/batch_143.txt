The data are representative of three independent experiments.
This procedure is repeated over s ≤ t and for possible k-values.
Currently, the vast diversity of information available through the Internet, including unverified malicious information, can spread quickly and can misguide HCWs.
Supportive evidence for this comes from studies of focal damage to the left middle temporal gyrus, suggesting that this damage results in profound language comprehension and semantic deficits (Hart and Gordon, 1990; Hillis and Caramazza, 1991; Kertesz et al., 1993; Dronkers et al., 2004) .
