direct when the two airports are connected with direct flights and indirect when the two airports are connected only with connecting flights), then the probability that the agent selects a given path is proportional to the relative number of passengers traveling in each direct or indirect flight from origin i to destination j.

With the above parameter and model settings, the best-fitting remaining parameter values, denoted by asterisk and obtained using a Nelder-Mead minimization algorithm, were LSE: In Figure 8A we see that the LSE and MLE provide similar fits, though both provided relatively poor fits to the first third of data: these data reflect a more linear than the exponential initial phase which is uncharacteristic of homogeneous SEIR models, particular those that have no spatial structure.
To demonstrate this, we took three different AMP prodrugs with distinct linker sequences (Table S1) with increasing kcat values for OmpT to decrease the B.A.H.
