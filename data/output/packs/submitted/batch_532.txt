The uncertainty in parameter values and the potential impact of infection control measures imply that all scenarios are plausible and should be considered when developing pandemic prevention and containment strategies.
A second important consequence of assuming the presence of an indirect route is that the selection pressure on virus mutants will differ considerably between lung tropism and gut tropism.

The remaining four drugs did not show a significantly different phenotype between the parental N2 and CB4856 strains, suggesting these traits might be less reproducible or that scb-1 variation does not underlie these drug differences.
Thus it is perhaps too early to dismiss the possibility of negative-strand ORFs in other (+)ssRNA virus lineages.
