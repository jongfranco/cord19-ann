This can be then interpreted as measure of evolutionary sequence conservation.
Viroporins are typically small hydrophobic integral membrane proteins of around 100 aa in size, with two motifs -an amphipathic α-helix and an adjacent cluster of positively charged residues; mutation of these residues generally abolishes viroporin activity 27 .
