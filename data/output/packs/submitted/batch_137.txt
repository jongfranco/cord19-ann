where r ij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j.
Because host-control periods lead to stochastic viral extinction, identifying the conditions in terms of critical parameter combinations that give rise to these dynamics is of practical importance.
Due to inherent challenges in sampling the lower respiratory tract, the pulmonary microbiome was not one of the original sites sampled in the 2008 Human Microbiome Project and data regarding pulmonary microbial communities in health and disease have lagged decades behind similar analyses of human intestinal, cutaneous, and nasopharyngeal microbiomes (27) .
This general, event-oriented approach, however, involves considerably more computations invoking numerical integration schemes than working directly with discrete models.
