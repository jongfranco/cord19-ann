Epidemiological outbreaks not only increase global mortality rates, but they also have a large socio-economic impact that is not limited to those countries that are directly affected by the epidemic.
When the first cases reported in a new location are mostly deaths, however, our results suggest that the underlying size of the epidemic would make control via contact tracing extremely challenging.

Co-treatment with carbidopa robustly diminished this effect (to 1.1 ± 0.3 fold over control levels, p = 0.02 vs. L-DOPA alone, N = 5) but did not impact the loss of parkin from L-DOPA treatment (30.9 ± 5.9% parkin loss with L-DOPA alone vs. 31.4 ± 4.7% loss with L-DOPA + carbidopa, p = 0.9, N = 4) (Fig.
