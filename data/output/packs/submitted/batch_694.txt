Strategies to identify and annotate viruses vary among different tools, ranging from analyzing marker genes, binning sequences or reads into taxonomic groups, assembling sequences into contigs and then annotating the taxonomy using the contigs, to directly aligning short reads to a reference database and inferring virus types and abundances based on the alignment results.
