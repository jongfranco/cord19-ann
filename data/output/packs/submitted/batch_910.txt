We next selected 16 potential repurposable drugs ( Figure 5A and Table 1 ) against HCoVs using subject matter expertise based on a combination of factors: (i) strength of the network-predicted associations (a smaller network proximity score in Supplementary Table S4 ); (ii) validation by GSEA analyses;
Thus, the majority of B-cell epitopes are a discontinuous or conformational structure (124, 130-132).
Based on our data, the timeline of the outbreak indicates rapid growth in several provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Wuhan.

scenario leads to a higher level of averted deaths than scenario 2, owing to the reduction in overshoot occurring after interventions are lifted (9) (10) (11) .
Most crucially, longitudinal serological studies from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 could indicate whether or not immunity wanes, and at what rate.
Several lines of evidence illustrate their future potential.
Interestingly, both the moderate and severe models showed sex-specific treadmill fitness profiles in which the female mice ( Figure 4A , C) were more severely affected than the male mice ( Figure 4B , D).

The solid dots represent the observed weekly incidence.
Technological advancements in structural biology and genomics have been important for identifying viruses, and for advancing fundamental viral research and antiviral therapeutics.
However, this might be due to the fact that the sentinel surveillance runs between October and March and thus had not started when our system detected an increase in cases [33] To establish the performance of the method, the outbreak detected by PHE was considered the ground truth [31] which allowed to estimate a specificity of 99.7% and sensitivity of 100% .

We obtained qualitatively similar results for Model 1 (Poisson GLM fit to daily case counts), Model 2 (negative binomial GLM fit to daily case counts ), and Model 3 (log-linear regressions fit to cumulative cases), see Table S2 .
Given the potential variability in this delay period between cases, in particular depending on outcome (mean onset-to-recovery and onset-to-death were estimated as 14.4-15.3 and 6.2-8.8 days respectively (32)), our results do not support the current WHO single criterion to declare the EO, irrespective of the last detected case's outcome.
As a kind of coronavirus, it poses a continuing threat to human health because of its high transmission efficiency and serious infection consequences [1] .
At each point in time first the current value of each slot is aged by a factor of e −η M (where η M is represented in the program by the parameter mem fade), and then the current population of the cell is distributed to the slots based on their nest of origin.

In support of this hypothesis, studies of natural ZIKV infections using either IHC or in situ hybridization analysis (ISH) have also reported that HCs were the most frequently observed infected cells (Bhatnagar et al., 2017; Martines et al., 2016a; Noronha et al., 2016; Rosenberg et al., 2017) .

Considering that the Chinese Spring Festival began on January 23 and the Chinese government initiated effective prevention, control and quarantine measures for the whole people, it can be considered that there are few new imported cases in all provinces, and the impact of migrant population flow can be basically ignored.
In addition, ciclesonide slightly but significantly inhibited rubella virus (having positive strand RNA genome) replication (Fig.
Finally, considering that SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV have posed serious concerns to public health and safety, it should be noted that many other bat SARS-like CoV strains that were evolutionarily convergent with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV recognized in this study may be potential novel coronaviruses to infect humans in the future.
While there is no direct evidence for redox regulation of this complex, activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells is associated with the intracellular increase of reactive oxygen species and release of zinc [36] .
