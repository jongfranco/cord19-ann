It is also possible for protons to tunnel about 1 Å, and by doing so cross a barrier that becomes available as depolarization proceeds.
The free energy profiles show that under force, there are minimally three states, which are F, I, and E. Because R ee cannot capture the complexity of the states populated as C and f are varied, it is important to consider R g as well to fully capture the phase diagram of the PK.
The CH-CDF analysis leads to the conclusion that all proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are ordered except Nucleocapsid protein, which is predicted to be disordered by CDF but ordered by CH and hence lies in Q2.
Further improvements could incorporate data augmentation techniques that may be able to produce historical time series with likely estimates of case counts based on onset of disease rather than reporting dates.
Our conclusions are based mainly on the hypothesis that sliding inhibition by the PFR organizes dynein activity, and localizes the spontaneous bending plane of the Ax as the one that passes from the Ax center through the MTs bonded to the PFR.
The sliding σ j (s) is defined as the difference between the arc lengths s and Π j (s).
