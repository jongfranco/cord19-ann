Actually, in the late stage of ASFV infection, induction of apoptosis could favour virus spread without the activation of inflammatory responses 22 .
A potential way to address these shortcomings is to monitor changes in marker proteins that are uniquely or predominantly expressed by specific immune cell phenotypes and to use this information to infer the dynamics of the underlying cell types.
Thirty micrograms (30µg) of total protein from each sample was then reduced with 10mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 55°C for 1h and subsequently alkylated with 18mM IAA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 30 minutes at room temperature, while keeping the reaction protected from light.

Phospho-Ub-dependent parkin loss does not require parkin autoubiquitination Of note, given that parkin has been shown to only autoubiquitinate in cis [98] , the finding that C431S parkin was not protected from L-DOPA-induced depletion indicates that this loss is not due to autoubiquitination.

After the virus infects the organism, the immune system carries on the immune defense to the virus and produces the specific antibody.
Obtaining these as a post-processing step, rather than explicit modification of Equation 2, preserves the original Bayes-Diallel model and therefore has no effect on the effect estimates (or variance projection estimates) for the other diallel categories.
