This is accepted with probability given by (11).
Countries which reported later than estimated are colored in red, while those reporting earlier than estimated are colored in blue.
Variation in viral or host abundance alone cannot drive the transitions between these two regimes, as these do not exist in the corresponding Lotka-Volterra dynamics under neutral conditions of hosts not acquiring specific immunity (SI D,E).

Moreover, POLYMOD by design oversampled children, whereas the BBC data oversampled adults, and hence may have captured more of the tail of the contact distribution in older age groups.
