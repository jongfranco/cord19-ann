where t is the number of days after 20 February 2020.
Regardless of the approach used to quantify the climate envelope of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, we are not characterizing the exact local temperature and precipitation conditions constraining the virus spread but rather determining the type of macro-climate conditions in the places where spreading is occurring.

Overall, the period from symptom onset to isolation follows a gamma distribution with a mean 3.7 (95% confidence limits are 3.5-3.9) days and a variance 16.1 (13.8, 18.7), corresponding to a shape parameter 0.85 (0.78, 0.93) and a scale parameter 4.35 (3.92, 4.81) .
Another plausible explanation for an increased abundance and diversity in the Archaea 303 domain in the AD mats is the killing-the-winner hypothesis [84], that proposes a negative 304 frequency-dependent selection, in which bacterial types are affected by viral pressure, promoting 305 the survival and viability of rare types, and thus maintaining high diversity.
In addition, the altitude at which our cohort lives is higher than 3000 m and so virus viability and virulence may be decreased.
The genome sizes of coronaviruses (∼30 kb) exceed those of most other RNA viruses.
slightly stronger seasonal forcing then Hubei) are assumed to happen at a rate of 0.01 per year for each infected individual elsewhere.
That the estimated 97.5 th percentile of COVID-19 incubation is 12.89 days (95% CI: (11.00, 16.13)) may suggest a long isolation or quarantine time (e.g.
Pre-incubation of IFIT1 and IFIT2 had no detectable impact on the inhibition of translation of the cap0--globin Fluc reporter and so was not examined further.
As before we measure time in multiples of the typical infectious period, so we set γ to 1.
The total probability of developing symptoms determines the fraction that remains asymptomatic or otherwise undiagnosed, i.e.
the average span of time needed for the virus to double the cases) and δ the average time for an infected person to die.
