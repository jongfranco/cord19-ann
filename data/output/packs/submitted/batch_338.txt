The fitted data is plotted every three days, and the error bar is the 95% confidence interval extracted from the 500 simulations assuming a negative binomial error structure.
The data sets for France and Zimbabwe contain multiple days per participant, hence we selected the first day for each participant (to minimise the effect of reporting fatigue).

These stability elements are thought to be particularly important for narnaviruses due to the lack of capsids or membrane-associated replication that other (+)ssRNA viruses use to protect their genomes (Fujimura and Esteban 2007) .
Additionally, a previous study showed that replacing the RBD of the lineage B bat virus, Rp3, allowed the virus to enter cells expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) 16 .

An alternative explanation is that the structure of strain diversity, emerging from the eco-evolutionary dynamics via specific immunity, explains the transitions between these dynamical regimes.
This includes heterogeneity between individuals, and averages over those individuals who infect few others and those who infect many.
Furthermore, we identified putative ac-pre-miRNAs that cleave in the 5p arm of the pre-miRNA (Table S3 and Figs 3C-D) , and thus are processed in the opposite direction of the currently known members of this pre-miRNA class.
These findings indicate that DRNet learned to assess the correct features instead of learning image correlations.
The evolution of an epidemic is usually described by either a deterministic dynamic model Kermack and McKendrick (1927) or a stochastic one ; Bailey (1975) , among which, the stochastic model is generally considered more realistic than the deterministic counterpart.
