Thus, the presence of the long rORF in highly divergent alphanarnaviruses cannot be explained as an artefact of RdRp ORF codon usage or GC bias.
In this approximationpreserving reduction, each candidate probe p is treated as a set whose elements represent the bases in the target sequences covered by p. The universe of elements is then all the bases across all the target sequences -i.e., what it seeks to cover.
