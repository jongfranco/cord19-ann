We experimentally evolved replicate 62 lineages of an RNA virus called Drosophila C Virus (DCV; Discistroviridae) in 19 species of 63 Drosophilidae that vary in their relatedness and shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million 64 years ago [35, 36] .
The second is residual signal structure.
However, effects induced by external changes such as the level of blood serum proteins (FBS) act on both delivery time and expression rate in a systematic manner.
For the purpose of constructing pseudo-realistic distributions, we do not attempt to correct for the fact that observed intervals may be sampled in a context more relevant to backward than to intrinsic generation intervals (see [8] ).
