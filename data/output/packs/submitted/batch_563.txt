A visualization of migration matrix M is given in Figure 4 , where x-axis and y-axis correspond to city i and city j, respectively, and the color intensity indicates the migrant volume.
This suggested that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with the luminal pH increase of the Golgi in addition to the secretory pathway disruption demonstrated in our previous work (23, 26, 29).
The widely applicable information 11 criterion (WAIC) was used to compare between distributions and the model with 12 the minimal WAIC value was selected as the best-fit model for each set of 13 estimates with and without right truncation.
suggests that there are tissue-specific changes in IFITM3 expression.
In responding to the pressing need for anti-2019-nCoV medications, we develop mathematics-based deep learning models to systematically eventuate FDA approved drugs in the DrugBank for 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibition.
For running this clustering-based approach, see the design naively.py executable in our implementation of CATCH.
We performed productivity analysis on full-length intron-retained reads using the FLAIR [51] pipeline, which corrects and defines unproductive transcripts as transcripts with a termination codon that is 55 nucleotides or more upstream of the 3'-most splice junction.
Biological process GO enrichment was performed using GOrilla comparing unranked background 456 and target lists (58) and redundant GO terms were removed using REVIGO (59).
The qualitative effects of z andḠ a /Ḡ s on q and R 0 remain robust when we assume narrower (κ s = κ a = 0.3; Figure S1 ) or wider (κ s = κ a = 0.8; Figure S2 ) generation intervals.
An analysis of a large assemblage of bacteria-phage infection networks found that these are predominantly nested rather than modular [16] but a later study suggested that structure depends on phylogenetic scale: modularity at large phylogenetic scales of species interactions and nestedness among interacting strains of the same species [17] .
To quantify changes in their anti-viral antibody repertoire, we adapted our recently reported z-score based algorithm to the pairwise differential quantification of peptide enrichments 13 .
Overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed among passengers and crew members.

Another prominent cluster can be observed in ORF1a in the WT nanopore sample, but not in SL2.
The calculation of the confidence score between two atoms takes two factors into consideration: The Euclidean distance between them, as well as the average confidence of voxels that lay in between the atoms in the backbone prediction.

Changes in mobility is another important aspect that is rarely integrated in school closure studies.
For Hubei Province, which has the highest number of cases and deaths, the growing trend is relatively stable.
In 125 addition, WT-MHV replication has been shown to be relatively resistant to the effects of IFN (1, 126 3, 22) .
Therefore, syndromic screening may have an additional role in helping to sustain control efforts for longer.
As we fixed the population size to be equal to the total population of the respective provinces, one might also ask how system size changes the results-for instance, if the outbreak is contained in a small region of a province, the effective population available to the transmission process will be substantially smaller.
Recent investigation showed that the viral load that was determined in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients 16 , implying that the viral load in respiratory specimens may not be able to objectively reflect the disease severity.
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab specimens was detected by real-time RT-PCR using ORF1ab/N gene PCR kit (Biogerm, Cat# SJ-HX-226-1,2, Shanghai, China) according to the protocol described previously.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to conduct normality tests because we only have 59 records and Shapiro-Wilk tests can do a much better job on small datasets with a sample size of from 3 to 5000 [13] .
For individuals in the same village, household members or non-nuclear connections, we 68 compared the distances for each genome of all connected pairs and a balanced random subset of 69 unconnected pairs; whereas we simply shuffled the associations of spouses and mother-child pairs.
A seasonality factor of 1 indicates equal seasonal variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2 as for the other human betacoronaviruses.

As an example, cigarette smoke induces epithelial damage resulting in increased expression of IL-33 17, 42 , which provokes hypersensitive IFNγ production by mouse NK cells in response to IL-12 44 .
As the closest known living relative of animals, we hypothesized that choanoflagellate 228 cilia would contain proteins conserved in mammals that are not present in the cilia of protozoa 229 more distantly related to animals.

For example, mirtron loci generate pre-miRNAs in a splicing-dependent and DROSHA-independent fashion (5, 6) .
SARS-CoV was initially identified as having occurred through interspecies transmission from small 72 carnivores (e.g., palm civets and raccoon dogs) to humans in 2003.
There has been a considerable overlap in the comorbidities which has been widely accepted.
In all cases, we found moderately positive correlations between the datasets.
It is worth noting that since both docking sites involve not only the CTD but also the NTD linker segment (residues 50-58) ( Figure 2B ), peptide binding would also interfere with the vital docking of NTDs during IN multimerization.
Other adhesion factors involved in leukocyte trafficking were either unregulated (CD34), downregulated (Selectin-P ligand, 2-fold), or modestly upregulated (MAdCAM-1, 2-fold; GlyCAM-1, over 2-fold).
For the test results reported below, the probability distributions for the incubation time and infectious duration time were taken to be uniform across a pre-determined range described below.
For each S-RBD-ACE2 pair, at least 3,000 independent docking simulations were performed to generate a large number of thermodynamically probable, low-energy binding conformations for calculating the binding freeenergy.
We excluded patients who arrived in these countries and regions after January 23 or were reported to have exposure to 2019-nCoV outside Wuhan.
Pre-symptomatic transmission would enable this.
Moreover, we observe CA residues T210, G208, and P207 243 interacting with the 11 RRR 13 motif of MxB, which accounts for the importance of these sites in 244 MxB binding ( Fig 3B) and sensitivity [9] .
We also tested if the loss of p53 in the first cell cycle enhanced this apparent checkpoint deficiency (Fig.
The epidemic starts in sub-population two but it then spreads to all the other.
At the same time, the mechanism of how these drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is also unknown.
The spike protein (protein S), which can be associated with virulence, was 76.2% identical to the reference strain of SARSr-CoV (Supplementary Table 4A ).
The S-protein consists of two subunits (i.e., S1 and S2) and is essential for the early steps of host cell infection: S-protein of a virion binds to the host cell receptors via its S1 receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) and then fuses the viral membrane with cellular membranes.
When uninformative covariates are included in a multivariate model, they may mask true associations and reduce the statistical power to detect informative associations.
The Timing-Only plot uses the 2 to 9 day incubation window and shows that (without using the genetic data) the range of possible timing scenarios more than triples the number of node pairs that are falsely linked by direct transmission from 3% to 10%.

For Italy, our estimated final fraction of population infected is found equal to 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]), which will be higher than Hubei, the epicenter in China of the epidemic.
279 Another study (50) found no TMPRSS4 mRNA in MDCK cells, potentially related to the 280 use of different MDCK cell lines (56).
However, we did not observe this affecting ISD in our data set.
The tree seems to clarify the relationships between the 3 Baltimore Classes 671 of RNA viruses by revealing the nested tree structure in which dsRNA viruses evolved, on at 672 least two occasions, from +RNA viruses, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from a distinct group of 673 dsRNA viruses.
Finally, supernatant was aspirated, cells were incubated in 1 ug/mL DAPI (Sigma Aldrich) and 100 ng/mL RNAse A (Sigma Aldrich) in B-PBS with 0.5% NP-40 overnight at 4°C in the dark.

From this condition, we obtain that the growth rate peak occurs in time time .
The collected data are with varied quality, many descriptions of patients only told us when the person left Wuhan, or When she/he had suspicious contacts with persons from Wuhan or suspicious persons (Following, we call they are exposed).
