However, using this strategy and method is certainly more reasonable than directly "calculating the CR and CFR for the COVID-19 in the country with the ratio of cumulative discharge (∑x) and cumulative death (∑y) to cumulative confirmed cases."
The standard deviation parameters of 5 and 0.3 where selected based on test runs.
A review for cold exposure and immune function reported that lower temperature may repress the immune function [32] , particularly, our previous finding suggested that the phagocytic function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages declined under cold stress in vitro experiment [33] .
