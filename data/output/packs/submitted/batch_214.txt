Although we had previously inferred a role for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation in regulating Siglec-2 (Cariappa et al., 2009) , we have demonstrated that many of the phenotypes on the basis of which earlier conclusions were made, actually resulted from a mutation that was traceable to a commercially available C57BL/6 strain of mice (Mahajan et al., 2016) .
