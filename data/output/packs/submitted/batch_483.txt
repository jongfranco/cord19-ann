We account for factors that influence the estimated probability such as the underlying reproduction number, the reporting rate and the delay between the onset and the outcome of the last detected case, which for simplicity we will refer to as 'the onset-to-outcome delay period'.
The continental-wide analysis illustrates much commonality between settings, such as the relative annual incidence, and the connectivity across LAC, but questions remain regarding the interpretation of the varied data for ZIKV.
To investigate this problem we introduce two random sampling steps to the algorithm, which when not implemented would otherwise preclude consideration of longer transmission chains.
are cases that are linked together through an identified cluster event; "presumed infected date"
Finally, the image-level predictions were aggregated to achieve patientlevel diagnoses.

As an additional check, we simulated the expected serial intervals assuming the same aforementioned incubation period but two different infectiousness profiles, where infectiousness started on the same day and from 2 days before symptom onset respectively.
On the other hand, computational vaccinology approach speeds up the process of successful identification of potential peptide-vaccine candidates and greatly downsize the number of epitopes to be synthesized and analyzed for experimental assays.
Hence, the temporal changes of the susceptible population in (i), above, and local disease awareness and control related to (ii) do not affect R. With respect to point (iii) and other heterogeneities of outbreaks in different .
Furthermore, due to differences between DNA and RNA molecules, contaminating DNA sequences cannot be correctly base-called after sequencing and so are easily discarded [35] .
Additionally, in our testing of the NP and NC datasets, when VADR and VIGOR both pass a sequence they nearly always have the same annotations: 703 of the 705 (99.7%) of the CDS annotations with consistent product names (VP1, VP2 or nonstructural polyprotein) had identical coordinates in the VADR and VIGOR output.

Past research in the context of the deterministic models of transmission has demonstrated that there are three apparent equilibria: a stable endemic state, parasite extinction, and an unstable state termed the 'transmission breakpoint' which lies between the stable state and parasite extinction [34, 35, 36] .
