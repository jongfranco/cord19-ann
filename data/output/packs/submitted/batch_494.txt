Both the total number of mutations accumulated during replication and the probability of a recombination event increase with the size of a genome when replication mechanisms are conserved, though nucleotide substitutions from either process often lead to net reduction in fitness of progeny.
However, the data of kidney specimens from SARS patients showed normal glomerular histology with absence of electron-dense deposits, indicating the possibility of an active immunemediated glomerulonephritis was low.
It does not confirm or reject any of the hypotheses we generated about the potential transmission and evolution pathways nor does it provide causal explanation for the patterns found.

According to a study of geographic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number across China, seasonal variations in absolute humidity will be insufficient to prevent the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (26) .
A key example is given by the prediction models of the reproduction numbers: these rely on the generation time distribution that is usually estimated from contact tracing data collected at a precise calendar time.
