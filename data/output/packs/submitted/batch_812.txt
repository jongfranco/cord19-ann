Optionally (if i > 0), f map additionally requires that the probe and target subsequence share an exact (0-mismatch) match of length at least i to return that the probe covers the range.
However, cluster 5 also features a slightly lower average similarity with comparably high standard deviation, which indicates that this cluster may be slightly less coherent.
It is important to note that calculating the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree involves the estimation of multiple parameters, which at the very least must include a particular tree topology and a set of branch lengths.
