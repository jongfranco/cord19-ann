Alternatively, the repertoire of splice factors or the genes that are most spliced may 549 be of greater importance than just splicing in general.
Drug development by pharmaceutical companies is a market-driven and costly endeavor, and thus it is often a challenge when drugs are needed for diseases endemic only to certain regions or which affect only a few patients.

This is a particularly pressing issue, since a priori we expect large hospital outbreaks of MERS to be overrepresented in sequence data, whereas sequences from primary cases will be sampled exceedingly rarely.
The screen relies on 782 the premise that guide RNAs targeting genes that are overrepresented following 783 infection represent genes that when disrupted are protected against infection and 784 therefore likely represent factors with pro-viral activity.

This stylized example may serve, once more, to show why while population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also important for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka "flattening the curve."
