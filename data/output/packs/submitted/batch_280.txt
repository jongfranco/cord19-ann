1 Although some studies with varying sample sizes have described the clinical characteristics of patients with Covid-19, 2-7 and a previous study has reported the early transmission dynamics of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, 8 most recent data are required to illustrate the full spectrum of the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak in Wuhan.

The sensitivity analysis is reported in Table 2 , and we notice that increases when the mean of the serial interval increases and we remark that serial interval examined by recent studies is shorter than that earlier estimation [22] [23] [24] .

Cholinergic signaling is involved in the modulation of central and peripheral inflammation (Lehner et al., 2019; Pavlov and Tracey, 2015) , however, we still have limited information about how microglia respond to activation of cholinergic receptors in vivo.
The information of the cases released by local authorities outside of Hubei province, including the exposure history, was relatively complete and reliable, because less cases were reported outside of Hubei province and staffs working at local center of disease control (CDC) staffs had enough time to interview the cases as soon as possible.

the combined fitness being even lower than predicted from the observed individual effects), the range in the number of mutations needed to achieve the targeted attenuation level would tend to be reduced ( fig.
This therefore requires the aligned switch to vanish (Fig.
As phage host range is a difficult and debated phenotype to measure (60) , and plaque formation is known to be affected by many genetic and environmental factors (61) , this could well be the scenario for phi6-WT on hosts closely related to its original host PP, which express the same attachment site: the type IV pilus (62) .
(b) By default, CATCH decides whether a probe hybridizes to a region of a target sequence according to the following parameters: a number m of mismatches to tolerate and a length lcf of a longest common substring.
How a policy trade-off plays out in one place may be different than another even if two locations experience a similar set of COVID-19 cases.
The simulation process occurs as follows: proposed epidemic trajectories are generated in an initial step based on the above branching process, and these are then subsequently filtered by discarding all but those whose cumulative case counts match the known counts of the current DRC outbreak on known dates ( Table 1 ).

We favor the idea that virus interaction with host cell receptors induces actin rearrangements through Abl kinase activity, and that this brings cell membranes in close proximity to allow hemifusion followed by full fusion (55) .
In some more generalized cases, the mean-field equation is a large scale approximation of the corresponding stochastic model, which can be seen as a process version of Law of Large Numbers.
