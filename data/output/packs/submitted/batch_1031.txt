Using the fitted relationships of the environmental drivers of transmission 335 and R0 will enable future analyses and comparisons between diseases and geographic regions.
Once the infected are quarantined, we assume their probability of infecting susceptible individuals is zero, and thus no matter the infected are recovered or not, they have no effect on the dynamics of the epidemic system.
We also fitted the outcome model with an additional interaction term between pre-existing log-titer to strain i and pre-existing immunity to previous exposures in order to account for the effect of their interactions on the mediation effects ( fig.
These data suggest that MAV-1 is not affecting PKR translation through 223 interaction with the 5' UTR of PKR.
If the answer is "no", and the intervention will be abandoned at some future time regardless of the new infection profile, then this is a one-shot intervention, and it should be held in reserve until it will have more impact.

These findings are consistent with other studies (Franco et al., 2018; Van Groningen et al., 2017; Ooi et al., 2016) that have shown enhancer activity is more sensitive than gene expression for sample classification (e.g., tumor-normal, tumor subtypes, cell types).
For 361 example, alpha-herpesvirus vhs directly interacts with translation initiation factors, and it is 362 generally believed that these interactions mediate RNA targeting (Doepker et with RNAs through interactions with Pol II, and thus only Pol II transcripts are normally spliced 372 (Gu et al., 2013) .

Point estimates may be helpful, but quantifying the uncertainty in those estimates is even more important in the context of infectious disease outbreaks because uncertainty is intrinsic, and accounting for plausible outcomes apart from the point prediction is critical.
