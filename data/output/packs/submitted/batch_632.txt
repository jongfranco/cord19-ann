Our study demonstrated the highly expression of ACE2 in kidney and testicular tissue and facilitated the understanding of the mechanisms of abnormal renal function and kidney damage in 2019-nCoV-infected patients.
The trend is usually steeper and ahead of time in the center of the epidemic compared with other regions.
The resulting "road-map" can help policy-markers and public-health officers retrospectively evaluate both the effectiveness and unexpected outcomes of their interventions.

Furthermore, because these modifications on Alovudine and AZT are on the 3' carbon in place of the OH group, they directly prevent further incorporation of nucleotides leading to permanent termination of RNA synthesis and replication of the virus.
The delay distributions between the reporting systems are strikingly different (Figs.
We performed Enrichr analyses on our panels of clustered downregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis.
