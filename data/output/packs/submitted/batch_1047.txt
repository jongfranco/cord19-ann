A more general case that assumes transmission is essentially i) density dependent when population density N is small relative to some function-location parameter L, and ii) frequency dependent when the population is much larger than L, takes the form τ (I, N ) = βI N + L More complicated functions have been proposed [12, 21] , including a negative binomial expression that accounts for susceptible host aggregation [38] or the phenomenon of superspreaders [39] , however, they are also limited in adhering to the following assumption.
