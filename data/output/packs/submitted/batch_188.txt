However, the majority have an While ORF8 is a paralog of ORF7a, its lack of the TM segment, unique insert and significantly more rapid 247 evolution suggest that it has acquired a distinct function and has been under strong positive selection 248
Simulations of polyprotein variants bearing insertions or deletions that alter the distance between TM2 and the ribosomal slip-site indicate that the native distance (45 residues) is nearly optimal for the transmission of pulling force through the nascent chain (Supplemental Table 1 ), which is consistent with the observed patterns in frameshifting (Fig.
