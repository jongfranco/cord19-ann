Co-localization of endosomal compartments and MPs of other viruses has been reported before (Haupt et al., 2005; Carluccio et al., 2014) ; however, this is the first study showing that a viral MP resides in the TGN, extending knowledge of the involvement of post-Golgi trafficking pathways in virus movement.
To correct for this bias, signal intensities were converted into mass fractions (MFs), which include the relative signal of each released subunit over time (Table S 2 To determine the relative cleavage efficiencies in the full-length substrate, we used the relative MFs between nsp10, nsp9, nsp8 and nsp7 at 3.3 h (100%, 66%, 36 % and 36 %, respectively).
The complicated processing procedure of the sample during the laboratory test is removed, the test result can be obtained quickly, the operation is simple, the safety of medical staff can be protected, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.
This demonstrates the added benefit that the P2A parts in the MTK provide a potential "universal" method to detect protein expression from multicistronic constructs.
The best fit incubation period distribution is a gamma distribution with a mean 7.2 (6.8, 7.6) days and a variance 16.9 (14.0, 20.2), which correspond to a shape parameter 3.07 (2.62, 3.56) and a scale parameter 2.35 (2.00, 2.75).
