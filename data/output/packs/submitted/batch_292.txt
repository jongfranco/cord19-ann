age, gender, and patient address) that is critical for more detailed epidemiological analysis.
Whilst the reported and projected reduction in ZIKV cases is undoubtedly good news for affected communities, it is only because substantial numbers of individuals have already been infected.
These changes were not travel-related and may distort the estimated association to some extent.
