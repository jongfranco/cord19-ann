In support of this hypothesis, incubation of these DCs with kasugamycin-treated 385 splenocytes was sufficient to induce ISG expression albeit at lower levels than direct 386 aminoglycoside treatment ( Supplementary Fig.
Further, the mode of the Erlang distribution becomes increasingly peaked and approaches the mean as the number of subclasses increases.
Finally, to determine whether cDNA formation was specific to 244 virus-infected cells or to viral transcripts, we examined whether cDNA forms of an 245 abundant housekeeping gene, GAPDH, arose in uninfected cells.
