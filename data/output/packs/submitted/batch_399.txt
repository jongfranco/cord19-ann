Fourth, there is an uncertainty in the detection window time T. Since the epidemiological investigations are being actively implemented outside China, we believe that the sum of the incubation period and the infectious period can be a plausible estimation of the detection time window.

For the selective hypothesis, arguments to the effect that transitions are more conservative typically invoke a biochemical factor (or a composite such as the Grantham index) that correlates with patterns of evolutionary divergence, and is found to be more conserved by transitions than by transversions (e.g., Vogel and Kopun 1977; Zhang 2000) .
