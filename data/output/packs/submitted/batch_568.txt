which is also less conservative in other coronaviruses.
Furthermore, TXNIP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation resulted in cleavage of CASP1 to its mature, proteolytically active form.
Despite the outbreak of COVID-19 occurring in few scattered hospitals (e.g.

This will also improve as m j increases, but with the caveat that the parameters underlying bigger epidemics (specified by larger historical incidence values, and controlled through Λ(s)) are easier to estimate than those of smaller ones.
The risk of importation at city level was preliminarily defined as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk city, based on the population movement data in 2015 obtained from Baidu, Inc.
