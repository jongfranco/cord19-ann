However, during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-3, although entry screening at airports and other key locations was adopted in most countries its effectiveness was estimated to be very limited due to the relatively long incubation period and low prevalence of SARS, which resulted in extremely low positive predictive values at screening locations [10] [11] [12] [13] .
