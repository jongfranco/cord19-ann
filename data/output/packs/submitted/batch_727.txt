However, the sequencing chemistry as well as the properties of the motor protein are under constant development.
Here, we lowered the use of fragmentation buffer in the consideration of the small amount of RNA in the extracted sample as we noticed that too much fragmentation buffer could destroy the DNA nanoswitches (data not shown).
Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on changes in Scr and the frequency of Scr tests has a substantial impact on the detection rate of AKI 17 .
To test this idea, we used single cell flow cytometry to measure the amount of loaded MCM at S phase entry and live cell imaging to measure cell cycle timing to determine if the amount of loaded MCM differs between cell cycle re-entry and active proliferation.
