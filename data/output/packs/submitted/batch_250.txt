Based on this feature, we constructed a (time-varying) directed graph to characterize the traffic flows across the nation, in which each node stands for a province (or city).
Theoretically, the progress of killing the viruses with high temperature will damage the integrity of their RNA genomes in the samples, thus improperly reducing the amount of target viral templates, and eventually leading to high false negative rate of the virus detection.
During normal genome assembly, the assembler evaluates the 280 coverage at each "bubble" (where the de Brujin graph has two paths out of a node, and both paths merge 281 again at the next node) and ultimately has to retain one of the paths at the exclusion of the other ( Fig 3A)
