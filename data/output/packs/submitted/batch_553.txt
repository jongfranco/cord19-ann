In SARS-CoV M pro , however, the carbonyl groups of residues 186 and 188 might lead to a repulsion of the fluorinated benzyl group.
This earlier peak in virus shedding for SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to influenza virus shedding (16) than SARS-CoV, where shedding peaked around day 10 post onset of symptoms (15) , and may explain why case 40 detection and isolation may not be as effective for SARS-CoV-2 as it was for the control of SARS-CoV (17) .

Given the current epidemiologic circumstance and the limited health system capacity, optimizing clinical management approach on COVID-19 patients is both critical and urgent.
We simultaneously fitted our model to four data sets: (1) the number of confirmed cases by day of disease onset from January 1 to February 11, (2) the number of deaths by day of occurrence from January 1 to February 11, (3) the age distribution of all confirmed cases until 11 February and (4) the age distribution of all deaths reported by 11 February.
Taken together, these analyses indicate that both viruses and bacteria independently contribute to ARI, and that bacteria and RSV also independently increase the risk of infection spread to the lower airways.
