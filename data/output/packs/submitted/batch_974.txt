Our results show that compared to the WT virus, the abrogation of the NP-exo activity did not increase the mutation rate found in the MOPV genomic sequences present in the cell culture supernatant, but the emergence of the three mutants of rare occurrence are the direct consequence of the NP-Exo(-), which have relaxed the control over certain position implying a direct effect of the MOPV exonuclease on its own genomic RNA.
