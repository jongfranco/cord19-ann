The constructed knowledge graph G = (V, E) is an undirected graph, in which each node v ∈ V in the node set V belongs to one of the node types (including drugs, human proteins, and virus proteins), and each edge e ∈ E in the edge set E ⊂ V × V × R belongs to one of the relation types from the relation type set R (including two drug-target interactions, two protein-protein interactions and three similarities).

This is likely because the noncontact residues in the RBM play a supportive and structural role for these contact points, and indeed, these non-contact residues are different between the clades (figure s4).
Since the government intervention reduces the contact rate of all individuals irrespective of their awareness status, 228 it has a comparable impact on transmission for scenarios with fast and slow rate of awareness spread (compare 229 Figure 4 and Figure 5 ).
Hospital waiting times were extended, which increased the time before infected individuals were identified and placed into isolation.

Table 3 Table 4 shows the physiological and demographic features of those patients who were prescribed antimicrobial therapy OR admitted for clinical reasons (as a group that represents those patients requiring medical input) compared to the other patients seen who were either managed as outpatients, or admitted due to being unable to self-isolate.
To identify such cases of overlap between expression QTL and the drug-response QTL on chromosome V, we need genome-wide expression data for the RIAILs.

The results suggest that if the samples were prepared with an optimal solution, the detectable numbers of viral templates would be unchanged because virus inactivation progress with high temperature does not erase all the RNA but leave small fragments of nucleic acids that are good enough for using as the template for qRT-PCR detection.
Given that the binding of G3BP1 by the nsP3 HVD is proposed to be critical for SG disassembly [35, 36] and that the ADP-ribosylhydrolase mutant of nsP3 has a decreased ability to suppress SG formation (Fig.
