Model I regression lines are statistically indistiguishable in our set of 150 nonoverlapping viral genes vs. our set of 27 preoverlapping genes, which are therefore pooled (R 2 = 0.30 and R 2 = 0.24 for the +1 and +2 groups, respectively).

The current diagnostic standard combines clinical symptoms and molecular method, and as many of the symptoms resembles those of common cold and influenza, an accurate molecular result is critical for final diagnosis.
Combined with big data of the intercity traffics, the research work is even more help-ful to future epidemic predictions.
While friction-driven scission and disordered domain crowding are distinct mechanisms, they are not mutually exclusive and may therefore work cooperatively to drive fission of endocytic structures.
Two main assumptions are adopted in this model: (1) The interaction of people flow between domestic and foreign areas is ignored.

The relationship of all VirScan peptides to all human viruses can thus be represented as a matrix of alignment bit scores.
and 2 This approximation sensibly implies that domain growth 'dilutes' pairwise agent densities.
A correlation was observed between genome length and the 160 number of contigs produced during VI, where longer genomes returned proportionally more contigs as 161 expected as total VI occurrence should increase with length [r 2 = 0.967; p <0.0001 Figure 4b and 4c].
Hence we will make the approximation than the event 'the 425 excursion does not hit the treshold c' and the event 'no excursion generated by an infection by the reservoir and with initially two infected individuals, hits the treshold c' are equivalent.
However, the cellular levels were significantly lowered for FtsZ variants with reduced alphabet for their CTT sequences and κ values of 0.17 (RLV1) and 0.47 (RLV5), so designated because they were intended to be mimics of CTLV1 and CTLV5 (Figure 6B ).

Given configuration C2 (see Table 1 ), in which the endemic equilibrium value is situated closer to the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium, we find that an important phenomenon which exists in the individual-based stochastic simulation is not present in the deterministic model -this phenomenon is known as 'fade-out' in the parasite population.
