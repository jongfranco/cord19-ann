Because of the high number of observations, the impact of the priors on the outcome was negligible.
From passages 1 to 5/6, infectious titers continuously decreased (down to a 5 fold for the WT and down a 90 fold for the mutant compared to passage 1) before a rebound from passage 6 to 8/9 to titers similar to those of passage 2 followed by another general decrease at passage 10.
