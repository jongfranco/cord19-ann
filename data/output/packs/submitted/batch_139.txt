is the cumulative distribution function of latent cases that were transmitted a days ago but before recovery.
We have already discussed the fact that what we get is the energy minimum, which corresponds to 0 K. We noted this does have one advantage, in that it allows comparison with Xray structures that are determined at temperatures below the lowest phase transition of water, and are thus presumably not very different from the 0 K structures.

This approach also provides a natural way to allow for variable neighbourhood sizes, where ρ(x) depends on location x, so both rigid regions and transition regions are well modeled.
If R is currently 2.2, for example, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years.
