In the baseline model, only one parameter was estimated, i.e., R 0 , and it was given a non-informative prior R 0~U niform(0, 10).
We chose SLC16A14 and LINC00473 because they have high densities of FLC-specific enhancers with FOSL2/JUN (Fig.

Artifact of the Here we test the predictions of all three hypotheses, as summarized in Figure 1 , and find that both the birthfacilitation and conflict-resolution hypotheses play a role.
However, the sex ratio of later cases without reported travel history (category IV) shifted to approximately 1:1 (57 male vs. 62 female, X 2 test, p-value < 0.01), as expected under a null hypothesis of equal transmission risk (Fig.
Additionally, this U-Net also predicts the backbone location of the protein, which is defined as the position of all Ca, C, and N atoms of the structure.
GO analysis revealed that FBS and MP coronae were also enriched in terms such as anchoring, adhesion, receptor binding, protein complex binding, unfolded protein binding, interspecies interaction, viral process, and mutualism through parasitism ( Fig.

No patients were directly involved in our study design, setting the research questions, the interpretation of data, or asked to advise on writing up of the report.
By omitting poorly-aligned and highly-variable sections of the MSA, which are thought to create noise due to the difficulty of establishing true homology for each site (defined as similarity due to historical relationships by descent (49)), it is hoped that the resulting sub-MSA will retain a strong historical signal (defined as the order and timing of divergence events (50)) that will allow users to obtain an accurate phylogeny.
Patient age differed significantly between the two groups (63.7 ± 16.8 for ICU vs 48.6 ± 15.6 for non-ICU patients).
Our study considered the country to be isolated for the sake of simplicity.

Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources.
Our estimated 0 range of 1.6-4.2 for COVID-19 is consistent with other preliminary estimates posted on public domains [25-28], and is comparable to the 0 of SARS, which was in the range of 2-5 during the 2003 outbreak in Singapore [15] .
