To date, 41 deaths have been reported, all but two were from the Hubei province (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020).
Stratified results show that if the infector was isolated less than 3 days after infection the average serial interval was 3.6 days, increasing to 8.1 days if the infector was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later (Table S4 ).
We were curious to 262 assess if extreme elongation of NDC80C affected EP efficiency.
It is apparent from the incidence in 2017 that many countries no longer reported an increasing incidence of cases.
Larger studies may also help in revealing clinically-useful biomarkers.

The 194 analysis of whole cell lysates showed a reduction in processed nsP3 in presence of either the 195 enzymatically active ARTD12 or ARTD10.
Note that our application 3 of the classic MK test to discover the higher rate of adaptation in VIPs compared to non-4 VIPs is conservative given that the VIPs have a higher proportion of slightly deleterious We therefore apply an asymptotic modification of the MK test known to provide 10 estimates of α without a downward bias in the presence of slightly deleterious variants 11 (Messer and Petrov, 2013) .
