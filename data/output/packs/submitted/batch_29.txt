If we move along the curve, from proximal end to distal end, we first remain on a fixed plane (blue).
As lncRNA Gm15441 is antisense to TXNIP and its exon 3 almost entirely overlaps the Txnip 5'UTR, Gm15441 may block IRES sequences needed for translation of TXNIP.

But then interpreting what these ad hoc analyses tell us about social evolution in microbes is a verbal exercise in which theory is just a heuristic.
The evaporation rate was notably slow, perhaps because the volatile components (water) also dissolve in the skin.
Instead, we showed that PKR depletion is inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, implicating 315 proteasomal degradation of PKR.
