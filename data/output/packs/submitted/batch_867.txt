Moreover, patients with elevated baseline Scr demonstrated higher leukocyte count, lower lymphocyte count and platelet count.
Our model for infectiousness ( ) was solved first by fitting the shape of the pre-symptomatic + symptomatic contributions to our inferred generation time interval: these functions are proportional to each other when the transmission pairs analysed for the generation time distribution represent pre-symptomatic and symptomatic exposure in the proportion representative of overall epidemic spread.
Four hundred generations of the mutated plasmid being favored by selective pressure and cannot outcompete the wild-type plasmid is roughly the limit of the indispensability of any analyzed pGKL ORF in this kind of experiment (68).
