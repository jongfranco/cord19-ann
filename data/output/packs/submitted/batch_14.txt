Sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide (Angus & van der Poll, 2013) ; it arises when hosts response to pathogen infections such as bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infection and then injury their own tissues and organs (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013b) .

As has been shown in this work, GM1 is an implementation of domain growth that conserves colinear correlations in comparison to diagonal correlations, and GM2 is one that reduces colinear correlations as a rate proportional to the size of the domain.
The average age onboard the ship was 58, so our estimates of cCFR cannot directly be applied to a younger population; we therefore scaled our estimates to obtain values for a population equivalent to those in the early China outbreak.

Embedded within the pyridone, the P2 nitrogen can no longer donate a hydrogen bond to the protein; however, our previous crystal structures showed that the P2 mainchain amide of the linear a-ketoamides does not make a hydrogen bond with the protein in all cases, so this interaction does not seem to be essential .
