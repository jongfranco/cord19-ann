Second, clinical evaluation of children followed the 329 standards of a rural African hospital, so diagnostic evaluation was limited to physical 330 examination and malaria blood smears.
Worse, a study with data of more than 25 years found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality and low-humidity levels may cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms [39] , similar to a study carried out in the United States [40] .
Examination of SLC16A14 expression in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database demonstrated substantially higher expression in FLC tumors than any other normal tissue, indicating that it may be a useful molecular beacon for such approaches.
