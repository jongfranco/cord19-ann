For instance, 202 the members of the ICTV-approved order Bunyavirales are called bunyaviruses, whereas those 203 of the family Tombusviridae are called tombusviruses.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the estimation of the asymptomatic proportion needs to be handled carefully since real-time outbreak data are influenced by the phenomenon of right censoring, due to the time lag between the time of examination and sample collection and the development of illness.
The estimated epidemic doubling time is 1.20 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.44) 66 days and the corresponding R0 estimate is 3.58 (95% CI, 1.29, 8.46).
