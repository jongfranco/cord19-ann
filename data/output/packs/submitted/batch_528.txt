Sometimes calculations on relatively small to medium size systems are useful (136) (137) (138) (139) , but in general we need to make the clusters large enough that the part we are most concerned with does not have very significant boundary effects.

Such 'exclusive' forms of single-chain dimers are just useful analytical tools allowing us to address this point.
where β(t) and γ(t) are unknown functions of time.
And there are a small number of genomic regions that showed high peaks of immunogenicity corresponding to a large number of MHC binders in a small neighborhood, which could be better potential vaccine targets (Sup.
Although young age at infection, environmental influences such as tobacco smoke exposure, viral load and strain, low levels of maternally derived RSV-neutralizing antibody, as well as a multitude of genetic host factors have been associated with severe disease in some but not all studies 4,11-22 .
Currently, G4s are being investigated for their involvement in virulence and survival mechanisms of various human pathogen [46] .
Specifically, the order of operations for this analysis was as follows: 1) compute voxelwise statistics for 5000 permutations, 2) zero all voxels less than z=1.645 (p>0.05), 3) measure the number of voxels in the largest surviving cluster and save this variable, 4) rank order the 5000 observations of max cluster size, 5) threshold at the 100 th largest cluster size (i.e.

Together, these data confirm that EPS8 acts as a pro-viral host factor during FLUAV infection and exhibits specific effects on cell infectivity depending on the virus.
Much convincing evidence has recently emerged to support this notion, including: (i) both ZIKV and CHIKV have been repeatedly observed to follow similar patterns of evolution and spread in different regions (Musso et al., 2015) ; (ii) in an environment containing both species of Aedes mosquitoes, a significantly greater number of Ae.
