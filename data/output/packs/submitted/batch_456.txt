Both the sensitivity and the specificity of the model remained high when the analysis was restricted to all countries in Africa other than the three majorly affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) .
T1, together with the water at the intracellular surface, appears to create a path for protons; this does not necessarily include a role for the ionization of cysteine in T1, but it does make it probable that the ionization of T1 cysteines may be important.

The extremely high SI of S416 may be due to its high binding affinity and favorable occupation of the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH with faster-associating characteristics (kon = 1.76×10 6 M -1 s -1 ) and slower dissociating binding characteristic (koff=2.97×10 -3 s -1 ), which will reduce the possibility of off-target in vivo.
