These are useful because the cumulants are easier to interpret, i.e., κ 1 is simply the average number of secondary cases R 0 , κ 2 is the underlying variance, κ 3 is related to the skewness and κ 4 to the kurtosis of the full distribution.
However, at high influenza titres, we were able to reconstruct >99% 40 complete sequence for all eight gene segments.

We believe that fluorescence of the Cy5 labeled mRNAs is unquenched during the time of uptake due to unpacking of the lipid-based carriers.
For statistical methods, since sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number methods take the nonconstant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, they appear to be more accurate than the exponential growth and maximum likelihood methods in the late stage.

If some water enters the cavity which is left by the mutation, ionization can occur in situ, so that a central assumption of the method is not necessarily supported in this system; local changes in side chain rotation would be enough to account for the results.
