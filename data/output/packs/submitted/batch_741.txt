We then use the logarithm, as most cities reported zero cases of SARS resulting in:
Combining the data sources shows improved inference with The key here seems to be the uncertainty associated with assigning a time to the most recent common ancestor.
We hypothesize that the sequences correspond to DI-RNA molecules that may arise by recombination at TRSlike sequence motifs as well as other sites displaying sequence similarities that are sufficient to support illegitimate recombination events (see Fig.
Compared with children with IRF7 hi , those with IRF7 lo 302 had a slower progression of illness from initial symptoms to hospital presentation, a greater 303 likelihood of a hospital admission, and a greater chance of representation with a further 304 exacerbation.
