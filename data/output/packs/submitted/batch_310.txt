By utilizing this model, the approximate number of confirmed cases in the three countries at the end of March, April, and May could be predicted (details show in Figure.6 ), which could instruct the international medical resources allocation.
Because individual viruses are highly variable (differing in shape, composition, and organization) and the dynamics of a cylindrical particle close to a surface are complex, we did not seek to develop a model that quantitatively predicts the rates of virus migration that we observe experimentally.

The top graph presents results for the influenza 1918 dataset, while the bottom one is for SARS 2003 data.
One important benefit of using the proposed tvSVAR to model the transmissions is that the Granger causality matrix, B t , can provide both the direction and strength of the route on day t. For example, the ij th entry in B t measures the strength of the transmission from province i to province j on day t. The i th diagonal of B t represents the self-transmission in province i that captures the relationship between the growth rate in the current and previous days.
