These reports are inconsistent with the outbreak dynamics that we detected using travel surveillance (Figs.
However, proposals to extend the latter approach to state-space models that account for temporal relationships in reporting have existed in the literature since the development of these techniques(13-15) and have been applied in at least one infectious disease context (16) .

Therefore, people coming from endemic areas may be at risk their whole life irrespective of the moment they arrive to a nonendemic area as long as they are not treated.
