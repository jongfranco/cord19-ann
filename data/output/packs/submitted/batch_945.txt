The conserved amino-acids in these new MTase set remain essentially the same: two glycines of the SAM binding site (G54 and 56 in WBV, G74-76 in Ecm1), a histidine (H117 in WBV, H144 in Ecm1) immediately followed by either F or Y. Glu175 is also very conserved, and in the Ecm1 structure, its homosteric counterpart Glu225 is positioned close to His144 and interacts also with the guanine base, strongly suggesting that this MTase is an N7-guanine MTase.
