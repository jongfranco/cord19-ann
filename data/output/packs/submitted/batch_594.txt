This void is maintained also when an increased penalty for the bead discontinuity during minimization is introduced.
A primary challenge for virologists and public health professionals is identifying characteristics of viruses that lead to higher likelihoods of new outbreaks [1] .
Yet, the simulation resulting from the model does show some important qualitative features that are now discussed.
A MAD2 molecule has two well-characterized interfaces for protein-protein interactions: the "safety belt" characteristic of C-MAD2 conformation to which MAD1-MIM and CDC20 binds (11, (38) (39) (40) , and the dimerization domain (primarily αC helix) that allows MAD2 to form O:C or C:C dimers or interact with p31 comet or BUBR1 (13, 32, 36, 41, 42) .
