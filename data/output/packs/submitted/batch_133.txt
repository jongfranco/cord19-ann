We used a threshold p value of <0.05 for a statistically significant association.
The use of Harper's primers and probe in set n°5 allowed the detection of Xf strain at the same LOD 352 than for XF primers and probe in spiked Q. robur samples, but the detection was slightly better (a gain 353 of one Log unit) in the spiked C. monspeliensis samples.
To better understand and eventually prevent such viral outbreaks, it is critical to have timely identification and annotation of viruses.

This value is usually determined by adjusting the conditional infectivity, either parametrically or through a behavioral model within an epidemiological model to account for a school closure.
By contrast, we allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the 187 parameter range of > 0, defining a "constitutive" system as one containing any antiviral cells at 188 disease free equilibrium.
