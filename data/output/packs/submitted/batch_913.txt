where the matrix p i→j characterises the spatial spread between locations i and j based on a gravity model [21] , R t i (the reproduction number) reflects transmissibility in location i at time t, and ω is the typical infectiousness profile of a case over time after infection (see Methods for details).
In contrast to other classic transmission models like SIR/-SEIR (the susceptible, [exposed] , infectious and recovered model), which are mostly described by a set of ordinary differential equations [2] , the feedback system is constituted by a chain of discrete function blocks, such as proportional, time delayed, integral(or accumulative) blocks, and positive/negative feedback or feed-forward loop, etc.
