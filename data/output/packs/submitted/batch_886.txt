Our general contribution has been to provide a worked-out example of how variation in the structure of the population across a large scale may allow for the identification of variables with relevance to mechanisms of spread.

While VirBin focuses on sub-contigs that are more likely unique to one haplotype, MaxBin clusters whole contigs, which could contain regions common to multiple haplotypes and makes read coverage more heterogeneous.
However, creating, evaluating, and modifying such classifications in practice is a difficult task and requires situational awareness and data that would vary depending on the pathogen and outbreak setting.

For example, the switch from brood care to foraging is at least partly regulated by an 59 interaction between age and stable lipid loss [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 18, 19] .
Indeed, both regions have been previously reported as being critical for viral fitness: i) The conserved region (19 nucleotides) exhibit high degree of sequence conservation at the 3'-termini and is complementary to the 5' end of scenario in which the polymerase is able to incorporate a mismatch but is unable to elongate it, leading to a decrease of suitable genomic material to package, therefore without the ExoN control the number of functional RNP would be reduced and consistent with the loss of viral fitness observed here and else [61, 67] .
