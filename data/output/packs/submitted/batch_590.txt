Although the importance and genetic basis of the functional balance between HA and NA in IAV has been thoroughly characterized (Wagner et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2012; Yen et al., 2011) , it is becoming clear that transmissibility of influenza viruses within and between hosts depends on factors beyond the sequence of these two genes (Chou et al., 2011; Herfst et al., 2012; Neumann and unable to stably attach to the surface of the underlying epithelial cells once it is reached.

In this scenario we assume the enrichments are most likely due to a true infection, but that there is insufficient evidence to distinguish whether an infection originated from either or both viruses.
However, while we predict the outbreak to largely be over in these large cities, smaller more remote cities and peri-urban areas may still have susceptible individuals and experience cases.
