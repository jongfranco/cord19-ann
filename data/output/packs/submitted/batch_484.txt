To test if a single HLA-DRB1 position 11 allele was driving the top association signal (as opposed to all possible alleles together, as modeled by the omnibus test), we conditioned the top association signal first on serine and then on aspartic acid at position 11, by including the dosages of the respective variant as an additional covariate in the logistic regression model (Figure 1 , Table 2, Supplementary Table 2 Table 2) .

RNA interference (RNAi) is an effective therapeutic strategy to silence the expression of target genes in many remediation processes including cancer therapy.
[3] However, since the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China is small, their estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan may not be precise and has large variability.
These data are often problematic for reconstructing outbreak dynamics because of reporting delays and 'spikes' (e.g.
