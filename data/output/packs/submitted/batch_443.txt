4 , shows that purified DBP-MAF, used as positive control, bound NAGAB_HUMAN only after 4 h incubation, reached a peak at 48 h, and returned below baseline values at 120 h. PMF, diluted 1:10 with PBS, had an initial value (at time 0) higher than that observed with PBS alone and higher than that observed with purified DBP-MAF; we interpret this result as indication that PMF has a much higher NAGAB_HUMAN-binding activity in comparison with purified DBP-MAF.
