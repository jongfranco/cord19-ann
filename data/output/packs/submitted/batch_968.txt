In order to improve the half-life and the solubility of the compounds in human plasma, and to reduce the binding to plasma proteins, we have modified the compound by hiding the P3 -P2 amide bond within a pyridone ring and by replacing the cinnamoyl group.
This lower basic reproduction number, and the recent apparent reduction in numbers of new infections, justifies the decision to close Wuhan city, and also shows the potentially high impact of self-quarantine and voluntary exclusion methods.
We compare the impact of differences amongst previous estimates of the incubation period distribution for COVID-19 and analyse data on clusters of confirmed cases from Singapore (January 21 to February 26) and Tianjin, China (January 14 to February 27).
To fix this under-reporting issue, we develop a calibration procedure with the detail in Appendix C. Below we briefly describe our approach for the calibration of the infected cases.

The raw moments of a normal distribution are quite complicated, but the cumulants are simple: κ 1 is equal to the mean R 0 , κ 2 is equal to the variance σ 2 , and all other cumulants are 0.
This method is thus capable of estimating the posterior probability of a given mutation being synapomorphic or homoplasic by integrating over different tree topologies.
