ER stress is characterized by disruption of ER lumen homeostasis, which leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER.
This difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses.
All of these could potentially be used both as a therapeutic and as a prophylactic measure.
We did not use ρ in the simulations because preliminary analyses indicated that this measure is highly dependent on network size and therefore cannot be used to compare between networks.
For example, the MTK already expedites the production of sgRNA expression vectors, and with the prevalence of sgRNA screening approaches, we envision incorporating barcoding capabilities that can be read by bulk and single-cell sequencing technologies [36] [37] [38] .
Next, the slope of this mean signal is calculated between every two consecutive points.
