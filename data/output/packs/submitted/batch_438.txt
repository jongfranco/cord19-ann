For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3).
Neither ORF could be identified within the white bream virus genome, a bafinivirus 506 that constitutes another genus within the subfamily Torovirinae (35), although the 507 lack of multiple bafinivirus sequences makes comparative genomic analysis 508
Although we confirmed that a JNK/p38 signalling module is involved in the induction of virus-induced apoptosis, our data suggests that DUSP1 has a proapoptotic function independently of JNK and p38 during SeV infection.

The finding that the conservativeness of transitions is a rather weak effect increases the prospects for the alternative mutational explanation, in which the rate at which new alleles are introduced by transition mutations is several-fold higher than for transversions, and this bias predisposes evolutionary change to happen via transitions.
Parker hydrophilicity of S protein was found to be 1.238 (average), -7.629 (minimum) and 7.743 (maximum) (Fig.
