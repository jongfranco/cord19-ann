Since, the dogs are territorial (Pal, 2003) and our surveys were conducted over 132 two or three consecutive days in each village, we assumed the individual populations were 133 closed during survey.
According to previous studies on middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), smokers and COPD patients might be susceptible to MERS.
These tokens form the identifier set for that particular sequence step.
Initially REFMAC refinement worked better for the structure which was subsequently moved to PHENIX to finalize the refinement.
However, in these experiments, a large fraction of cells exhibited low firing rates.
To analyze the size distribution of viral RNAs for each jelly type (i.e.
