Previous models of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortex connectivity suggest that parallel pathways play a role in regulating sensorimotor, associative, and limbic information processing [Haber, 2003; Haber and Calzavara, 2009; Cohen and Frank, 2009 ], however, McFarland and Haber [2002] proposed that such parallel connectivity patterns are not one-way loops and the pathway back to cortex has one component that reinforces each cortico-basal ganglia circuit and one component that relays information between circuits..
On the other hand, it is due to the information lag of the central location.
