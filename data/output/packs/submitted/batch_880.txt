The overall mean for sex bias, quantified as number of male pups weaned divided by the total number of weaned pups, was 0.4979, and did not significantly differ from our expectation of a 50:50 sex ratio (Binominal test, two-tailed p = 0.219).
The main reason for false negatives is the limited sample size of GTEx, and that for some exposure traits, the number of instruments available may be small.
Meanwhile, we found that two secondary cases were infected through sharing the public elevator with cases from their neighbors, which indicates the higher risk of transmission of NCP in community.

Finally, as with other infectious disease analytical approaches, our method assumes that cases were infected in the same order that they were observed (39, 59) .
However, these countries present variable levels of capacity (ranging from 34 to 75) and an overall low IDVI (<46) reflecting a high vulnerability (except Morocco, with IDVI equal to 56).

and 3) Can COVID-19 spread through the ocular route or present as the primary infected site?
This unexpected result is stronger for "internal overlaps", in which one gene is completely contained within its overlapping partner (23 +1 events vs. 1 +2 event, p = 3×10 −6 ), and is not found for "terminal overlaps", in which the 5 end of the downstream gene overlaps with the 3 end of the upstream member of the pair (9 +1 events vs. 9 +2 events).
