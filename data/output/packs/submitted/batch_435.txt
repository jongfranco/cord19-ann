Because clade 1 spikes enter cells expressing human ACE2 without addition of protease but clade2-clade1 chimeras require protease, our data suggests the spike protease cleavage site is adapted to the protease environment of the receptor-bound RBD (figure s5).
Given their genome-level phylogenetic disparity, the high similarity of RBD protein sequences between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV may suggest their evolutionary convergence in the spike protein.
