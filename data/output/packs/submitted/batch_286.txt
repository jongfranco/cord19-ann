Thus, our analysis is likely to underestimate the severity of the facemask shortage experiencing by the healthcare workers and the general population.
This is expected since a higher overall transmission rate leads to show that there is some negative correlation betweenand ', -and ', and " and p. These correlations are not surprising: the 603 more transmission that is explained by proximity to infectious individuals (the higher -), the less needs to be explained by the 604 background transmission (the lower '); the flatter the spatial kernel (the larger -), the fewer infections need to be explained by 605 the background transmission; and the more infections are accounted for by transmission within the same household (the higher 606 "), the longer the incubation period (the lower p) needs to be (due to long times between onsets of cases in the same household).
JS, MEW, JT, and LBB designed the study.
We found that within-group fitness benefitted most from this approach, with the withingroup fitness ratio commonly being a log-log function of mixing ratio (e.g.
Note that option dic=T enables to calculate the deviance information criterion (DIC) for model selection, while options, save_files=T and save_mcmc, allow the storage of MCMC output tables, plots, summary statistics and even full MCMC draws, which may be saved via the path of file_add, or otherwise via the current working directory.
