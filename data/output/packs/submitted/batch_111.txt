Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that when E. coli are exposed to the AMP prodrug, our model can be used to predict bacterial growth kinetics, which ultimately result in a binary 15 outcome.
For example, we assumed that no super-spreaders exist in the model, but there is currently no supportive evidence.
PIVs were less likely to be detected with RSV (p=0.05) or IFAV (p=0.03), and RSV was less likely to be found with IFAV (p=0.002) than expected.
In addition to mechanical force (f ), it is known from several ensemble experiments that the stability of BWYV PK, like other RNA molecules, depends on monovalent and divalent cations [33] .
If θ causes r θ to over-regularize, removing too much structure from the raw reconstruction, then E increases as the structure retained by r θ no longer cancels corresponding structure in the opposite half-map.
Probabilistic consistency transformation is the technique that converts a probability between a target homolog and each support homolog into a metric that summarizes the phylogeny among all the homologs.
