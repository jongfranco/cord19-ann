The evidence provided here, the previous studies on G4s in viruses, and the possibility to correctly classify the majority of viruses based on their G4 features (Table 3) suggest that most of the virus classes adopted G4-mediated mechanisms to control their viral cycles.

The best fitting result is shown as green curves in Figure 8 .
Passage of CoV into the cytosol requires processing of viral proteins by lysosomal proteases to enable fusion with lysosomal membranes and release into the cytosol; HOPS depletion prevents CoV from reaching the lysosome and thus fusion and release cannot occur (100).

The public containment leverage is fluctuating more strongly with values ranging between P = 0.07 and P = 1, where generally, lower values appear concurrently with a higher quarantine probability, which suggests that stronger quarantine implementation requires less public .
