The correlation results between mortality counts of COVID-19, meteorological measures and air pollutant concentrations were presented in Table 2 .
Because clinical symptoms, pathogen concentration, and behavior of the patient can change throughout the course of disease (25), we allow relative infectiousness to vary with time τ since onset of infectiousness ( !
Thus, there is a need for unbiased, sequencing based approaches to gain a more comprehensive understanding of pre-miRNA expression and sequence content.

For the complete data generated, see the Appendix.
To estimate the impacts of new COVID-19 cases in other cities on a city's own COVID-19 new case, we first calculate the geographic distance between a city and all other cities using the latitudes and longitudes of the centroids of each city, and then calculate the weighted sum of the number of COVID-19 new cases in all other cities using the inverse of log distance between a city and each of the other cities as the weight.
Notably, only the AMI patients had more than two comorbidities (n=5).
Were more sequences of MERS-CoV available from other parts of Africa we speculate they would fall outside of the diversity that has been sampled in Saudi Arabia and cluster with early MERS-CoV sequences from Jordan and sequences from Egyptian camels.
As compared to the 81 plasma from healthy donors, plasma from patients from day 10 post-symptom onward 82 reacted strongly in ELISA binding assays to the S ectodomain (p-value < 2e-16, two-83 tailed t-test) and RBD (p-value = 2e-13, two-tailed t-test) of SARS-CoV-2.
It is therefore possible that IFIT3 could interact with IFIT2 in a similar domain swapped manner (modelled schematically in Figure 6 , top right), consistent with TPRs 1-4 in the N terminus of IFIT2 being sufficient for the interaction as reported previously (29) .
(2002) define the reservoir from a practical point of view in order to take into account all hosts epidemiologically connected to the host of interest (i.e.

We also detected Human Coronavirus and 41 generated a near complete Human Metapneumovirus genome from clinical samples.
Thus, while the gene expression signature of social stress may be somewhat conserved across different types of social adversity, and potentially across species, it does not appear to be highly conserved across pathogen environments.
Note that here the model framework extends the model structure in our previous study by including the quarantined suspected compartment [18] [19] [20] , which consists of exposed infectious individuals resulting from contact tracing and individuals with influenza like illness and common fever needing clinical medication.
