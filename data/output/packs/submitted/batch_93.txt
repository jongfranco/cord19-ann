Despite the use of conjugate priors, the probabilistic assignment of reads to species involves the expansion of the likelihood into K n terms which is computationally infeasible through direct computation.
For each species-pair, we quantified range overlap as the number of raster grid 540 squares jointly inhabited by the two species (in the Mollweide projection, which exhibits 541 equal grid size), divided by the total number of grid squares occupied by these species 542 combined, so that each value was scaled from 0-1: overlapA,B=gridA,B/(gridA+gridB-gridA,B).
