If this calculation fails, we consider regression analysis as questionable.
Surprisingly, the distribution of the rORF does not appear to be monophyletic.
The six other founder strains did not significantly differ in their average litter sizes between the two facilities, but tended to have smaller weaned litters at UNC GMB (see Discussion).
Given that the N-terminal MD possesses enzymatic activity to remove ADP-ribosylation [38, 45] and the structural integrity of SGs is dependent on ADP-ribosylation [19] , we hypothesized that the macrodomain of nsP3 (nsP3 MD ) could be responsible for suppressing SG formation.
The epidemiological model with recurrent introduction of the infection into an incidental host by a reservoir can be 135 approximated by a branching process with immigration from the reservoir to the incidental host at the beginning of the infectious process (thus assuming that individual "birth and death rates of infected individuals" are constant during the starting phase of an outbreak).

The finding here shows the importance of the filtering criteria in removing viruses that might be annotation artifacts caused by repeats, low coverage, and small genome sizes.
There was no enrichment in mutations observed at 4-fold degenerate sites, suggesting that those regions do not correspond to any further recent recombination events (Supplementary Figures 5-8 ).
Notably, such a merger seems to have occurred on 632 at least three other independent occasions in Branch 1 because several groups of invertebrate 633 holobiont "narnaviruses" and some "ourmiaviruses" encode distantly related SJR-CPs that 634 apparently were acquired from different groups of plant and animal viruses (Figure 7) .
To identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports.
