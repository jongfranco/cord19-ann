The observed budding behavior is reminiscent of the dynamic nature of multivesicular LEs in live cells, for which ESCRT-dependent ILV inward budding and exosome outward budding are tightly connected to the unique LBPA-enriched lipid mixture observed in LEs (111).
We observed ten allelic differences at IGKV gene loci, and one allelic variant at IGKJ2; ten of these allelic variants, including IGKJ2*04, involved non-synonymous changes.
However, 106,741 reads were mapped to the forward strand of the viral gRNA in this case -corresponding to a coverage of approximately 3.8-fold -and these reads were generally evenly distributed along the gRNA; hence, the sequencing depth in this replicate was deemed sufficient for further analysis.
Accordingly, we found a sharp (~3-fold) change in RNA-seq read coverage at the bTRS.
