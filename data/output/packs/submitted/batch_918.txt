Such membrane alterations are known to affect the activity of membrane proteins like receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and nutrient transporters [50] .
6 Amplicon detection is typically achieved using fluorophore-labeled probes that are measured using fluorimetry or converted to a color readout using lateral flow assays.
We assume that transmissibility in each location stays constant within each time window and thus, within a time window, we estimated a single reproduction number for each location.
For example, the outbreak is more severe in Wuhan compared to other cities in China that constrains the medical resources, therefore the infected need a longer time to be confirmed and reported in the official released numbers.
