It is noteworthy that in our analysis of ribosomal pause sites, we did not see pausing at the AUG of the previously described 11 amino acid uORF of the genomic mRNA (AUG at nt 131-133; Boursnell et al., 1987) , and indeed there were few reads on the uORF itself, indicating that it is not heavily translated.
Ca 2+ , it could be argued that fusion of MERS-CoV is regulated by Ca 2+ to the membrane.
We found that L-DOPA causes parkin loss via two distinct pathways: an oxidative stress-dependent pathway driven by L-DOPA autoxidation and an oxidative stress-independent pathway, each of which is responsible for about half of parkin loss (Fig.

Recent studies have examined other modes of transmission in cholera, (including transmission within households) [37] , but we have chosen to focus on waterborne transmission.
These alignments were then extended to find all matching bases.
Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by their responses that they have recorded in SARS-CoV (or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 9 February 2020).
