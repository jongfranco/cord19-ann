Surprisingly, the protease-dependent entry phenotype was consistent in the reverse spike chimeras in which we replaced the RBD in clade 2 or 3 spike with a clade 1 RBD (figure 5d), suggesting that either the protease site between S1/S2 is not compatible with the chimeric spike backbone or the protease is not expressed in these cells (figure s5).
The primer design also partially relies on the chosen gene.
