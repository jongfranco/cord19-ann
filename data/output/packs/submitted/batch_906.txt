As in any active outbreak response, the data were collected by multiple teams under protocols that, by necessity, changed as the situation developed.
16 Since the symptom onset date of the first-generation cases in different clusters were different, we centralized the symptom onset dates of all first-generation cases into a specific date, and the symptom onset dates of secondary cases were transformed accordingly.
The hand washing effectiveness rate which indicates the average time that washed hands become again contaminated is set to θ = 1/1.5 hours -1 (i.e.

The other one had no epidemiological history on presentation, but another patient, who had had dinner with him, was also diagnosed to have COVID-19 later.
Although the precision of the inferred cluster was above 248 75% for 93% (88-93%) of the cases, 31% (6-39%) had a sensitivity score below 0.5, meaning they were 249 classified with less than half of their reference clusters ( Figure 4C ).
Cells were obtained from the naso and oropharyngeal sites using separate swabs, which were both eluted in a common transport media.
They often have a larger vulnerability to infections because of limited prior immunity, and they mix at school with high contact rates [80] thus representing key drivers for influenza spread.
Only replacing all 14 contact points and the surrounding amino acids (also known as the receptor binding motif, RBM) lead to increased ACE2 entry with clade 2 and 3 RBDs (figure 4c; 2→1 version 3 = clade 2 residues 322-400 + clade 1 residues 400-501; 3→1 version 3 = clade 3 residues 322-385 + clade 1 residues 386-501).
Conversely, the distinction could support the logical conclusion that All rights reserved.

As a consequence, if we denote by G[N, β, γ] the number of susceptible individuals consumed by the excursion of a supercritical branching process with individual birth rate βN and individual death rate γ conditionned to get extinct, we get:
These data may also represent a period of high transmission (due to favourable seasonal conditions, stochastic variation or selection bias in detecting large clusters of transmission) that will not be sustained over long periods of time.
