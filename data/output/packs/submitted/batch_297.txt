Influenza is mainly sustained in patches having larger R p during those periods, and epidemic activity is then transferred to other patches through the mobility of infected individuals.
One step in evaluating the lexical retrieval processes during connected speech has been through the use of blocked cyclic picture naming, where subjects repeatedly name pictures in sets of either semantically related or unrelated pictures, cycling several times through the pictures in each block.
Thus, wS remains the important target for vaccines and drugs previously evaluated in SARS and MERS while a neutralizing antibody targeting the wS protein could provide passive immunity [68] .

Control, structured coalescent with more than one tree per genome Due to concerns that recombination might affect our conclusions (Dudas and Rambaut, 2016) , as an additional secondary analysis, we also considered a scenario where alignments were split into two fragments (fragment 1 comprised of positions 1-21000, fragment 2 of positions 21000-29364), with independent clocks, trees and migration rates, but shared substitution models and deme population sizes.
2088 animal associated virus species in the five evaluated Baltimore groups remained after removal of zoonotic virus sequences.
The time from the illness onset to death is also comparable to SARS [16] , and the 15-20-day mean delay indicates that a crude estimation of the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to that of confirmed cases will tend to result in an underestimation of the case fatality risk, especially during the early stage of epidemic spread.
Therefore, among the Passiflora leaf extracts evaluated P. alata (1) stands out with 252 promising cytotoxic activity, followed by P. capsularis (2) and P. quadrangulares (9).

This allows us to "predict" when COVID-19 is most likely to be reported by various countries.
Although we mainly conducted in vitro assays to experimentally validate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of olaparib and CVL218 due to limited time, it is natural to speculate that other PARP1 inhibitors may also have antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on our computational prediction and experimental validation results.
