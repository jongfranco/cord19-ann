In this multivariate model, 728 genes were associated with time since illness onset and 135 genes were associated with the presence of any bacterial pathogen (Table 2) .
This difference is due in part to the fact that they are either intronless or have fewer introns.
Full-length genome analysis of 2019-nCoV patient samples revealed 79.5% and 96% sequence identities to SARS-CoV and a bat SARSr-Cov (severe acute respiratory syndrome-related CoV), respectively; however, sequences of the seven conserved viral replicase domains in ORF1ab show 94.6% identity between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV .
Therefore, how to better implement these measures will need to be further pondered in subsequent work.
We were 383 unable to include all the 23 observed EVD outbreaks with a case count greater than ten 384 cases in our estimates due to data availability.
qPCR is specific, rapid, and economic, but cannot 46 precisely analyze amplified gene fragment nucleic acid sequences; thus, positive infection is 47 confirmed by monitoring one or two sites (depending on manufacturer guidelines).
Whereas the RNA subunit of telomerase is expressed in most cells, hTERT expression is repressed in the normal cells, while in more than 85% of all tumor cells hTERT transcription is upregulated.
Although, serological and molecular diagnostic methods for economically important subspecies of C. michiganensis have been developed [2, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14] , these diagnostic tests are time consuming and may exhibit cross reactivity with Gram-positive bacteria and/or Gram-negative bacteria demanding further molecular test for cross confirmation [11, 15] .
