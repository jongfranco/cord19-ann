/2020 would substantially over-estimate the imported cases into major traffic hubs around Wuhan, and subsequently under-estimate the imported cases to more distant, but popular destination cities, such as Wenzhou.
This visualisation highlights the ephemeral nature of MERS-CoV outbreaks in humans, compared to continuous circulation of the virus in camels.

Today it is more or less clear that the predictions of the article apply only to China.
Even higher β = 1.5 is suggested by data in the US (March 4-10, 2020), which requires about 17-fold reduction of r C /r E ; reduction by 70 times would bring the epidemic to the regression phase with β R = 0.9, as was done in Hubei.
Provided the authorities continue to impose strict control measures, the epidemic will come under control by the end of April and is expected to end before June 2020, and as the quality of treatment improves, more rapid recovery will be expected.
The structures of PFN1 and P10 are restricted based on their relatively high rigidity found in the MD simulations (discussed below).
Further, a recent study in 98 participants with aphasia found that picture naming ability was not predictive of the proportion of paraphasias made during connected speech, finding that paraphasias produced in discourse in isolation were not well predicted by performance on confrontation naming tests (Fergadiotis and Wright, 2015) .

Infomap), which calculates network partitioning based on the movement of a random walker on the network (see for details).
Antibiotic success is markedly improved by proper titration of drugs, as overdosing leads to off-target toxicity and underdosing increases the likelihood of pathogens developing resistance 7 .
In practice that means that distributions at higher temperatures are easily sampled, improving the mixing.
Finally, no study specified how each individual symptom or comorbidity was measured.
Using this assay, we found that Amph-FL in the concentration range of 50-150 nM transformed vesicles with an average initial diameter of 200 nm (Fig.

In order to maintain the accuracy of the prediction and without hiding the underlying time trend, Rt values were estimated over a 10-day moving window.
also samples generated in our previous study ; GSE71708) that highly 530!
The determination of the value of R 0 is affected by the supposition that both the time from 159 the start of symptoms, and confirmation, and sub-notification proportions, are roughly constant 160 during the outbreak, resulting in a possible overestimation during the initial stage of the epidemic.

Strikingly, 599 infection with the DUB-negative virus resulted in a significantly increased survival compared to the 600 animals infected with the wt virus (Fig 4A) .
We generated a pseudo-realistic generation-interval distribution for Ebola virus disease (EVD) using information from [7] and a lognormal assumption for both the incubation and infectious periods.
Then, a correlation between root-to-tip genetic divergence and date of sampling was conducted in TempEst (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003; Rambaut et al., 2016; Yang, 1994) .
Similar to our previous 90 results (Zhan et al., 2019) , oral dosing of 1200 mg/kg PLX in C57/BL6J mice for two weeks 91 resulted 92.93 -96.2% removal of CD11b+ myeloid cells in the CNS (Fig S1) .
This kind of serial emergence allows for the possibility of host range mutations themselves to play a significant role in shaping the landscape of further emergence -one of the legacies of previous host use (7, 22) .
Assuming that generation intervals follow a gamma distribution with the meanḠ and the squared coefficient of variation κ, we have
Such scenario seems the most realistic and, although devastating for economy and social life, grants time to develop and administer vaccine.

Cryptic Zika virus transmission is likely still occurring in regions of the Americas, however, incomplete surveillance and reporting make this difficult to confirm and quantify.
Consistent with expectations, CGMD simulations suggest that the membrane integration efficiency of TM2 is enhanced by the LL mutations (51 ± 4%) and reduced by the EE mutations (11 ± 3%).
We also set the transition rate ( ) as an increasing function with respect to time t, thus the detection period 1/ ( ) is a decreasing function of t with the following form:
