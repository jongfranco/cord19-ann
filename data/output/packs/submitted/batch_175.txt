At best, a genome assembly represents the full genetic content of a species at chromosome level.
Our comparative analysis shows that aromatic-proline stacking contributes the most to the stabilization of PFN1-P10 binding, along with the formation of hydrogen bonds between serines/tyrosines/tryptophans and prolines.

135 was the number of infectious (I) on Jan. 1 st .
Three questions immediately arise, (i) what may be the reason for this functional dependency, (ii) are provinces other than Hubei mostly driven by export cases from Hubei and therefore follow a similar functional form in case counts as suggested by preliminary studies [10] [11] [12] , or, alternatively, (iii) is the scaling law a consequence of endogeneous and basic epidemiological processes and a consequence of a balance between transmission events and containment factors.

Note that prior probabilities do in fact depend upon the (mass spectrometry) data.
Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] .
