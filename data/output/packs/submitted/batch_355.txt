To start with, the ssRNA (-) group is the most heterogeneous one, since some viral species are significantly enriched in G4s up to the most extended G-island type (GGGG), while others lack this feature.
Only a subset of mice developed neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV, likely due to 32 growth medium (DMEM containing 2% FBS and 20 mM HEPES) were applied to Vero cells in 96-106 well plates and incubated at 37 o C with 5% CO 2 for 1 hr.
This strongly suggests the presence of a membrane-interacting domain in XP, which was not predicted by TM domain prediction software ( Fig.
This approach allows to identify nonoptimized, low-intensity energetic interaction-networks, corresponding to those substructures that can be more prone to establish interactions with Antibodies, and be suitably recognized by binding partners.
Considering there have 20% estimation error of errc, the peak value of I would be in the range of [52,438, 64,090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020.
All the patients had pneumonia-like clinical symptoms including fever and respiratory symptoms, whose distribution was similar in the two cohorts.
A confirmed case was defined as a case 55 with respiratory specimens that tested positive for the 2019-nCoV by at least one of 56 the following two methods: positive result by real-time reverse-transcription-57 polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for 2019-nCoV or a genetic sequence that 58 matches 2019-nCoV.
Thirdly, the time point at which symptoms were measured varied from illness onset (via recall) (9, (11) (12) (13) to clinical presentation (10, 14) .
OxICAT has thus far been applied to proteomes (redoxomes) of diverse organisms under different physiological conditions [17] [18] [19] [20] .
Two pediatric patients (case 1 and case 2) and their family members with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital.
is equal between all locality pairs, we expect that the actual amount of shared transmission 1276 between two localities is strongly influenced by the distance between those localities.
Analyzing of the genome of 2019-nCoV showed that this new virus shared around 80~90% sequence identity to SARS-CoV (2) .
320 In practical terms, these species-level rankings could set sampling priorities for public health 321 efforts seeking to identify hosts of a novel zoonotic virus, where one or more hosts are 322 already known.

We provide a method to regain prediction accuracy lost through this splitting process, leading to fast, efficient learning of long sequences on recurrent neural networks.
We estimated that expression of scb-1 mediates 61.3% of the chromosome V QTL for bleomycin response ( Figure 4, File S11 ).
We further included a term to account for the loss of active AMPs according to a proportionality constant, a * , that represents the number AMP required to kill one E. coli.
Of 59 samples, 29 were identified as members of various C. michiganensis subspecies, 16 were identified as C. m. subsp.
Among those isolated after, the symptom-based surveillance group were, on average, isolated 4.6 days (95% CI 4.1,5.0) after symptom onset, versus 2.7 days (95% CI 2.1,3.3) in the contact-based surveillance group.
This assumptions is tenuous at best: the host's age [33] , sex [34] , genetic makeup (particularly MHC locus genes) [35] , physiological state [36] , and history of exposure to the current and related pathogens (the latter due to cross-immunity issues [37] ) all play a role in affecting the vulnerability of the host to infection, the length of time the host is infectious, and the risk of the host dying from disease.
We found that chicken and guinea pig RBCs, which are often used to titer IAV virus and as the standard substrate for HAI assays, contained almost exclusively unmodified Neu5Ac, as did those from humans and 235 dogs (Fig.
Our estimates of the countries with higher risk of acting as source of importations are largely consistent with the reported source of cases (Fig 5) .

Antibody and ACE2 receptor interacting residues are highlighted on the sequence.
The combination of deleting the sample identification (ID) field, binning the test date range, and 590 truncating the FilmArray pouch serial number ensures that the remaining information is never unique, which indicates that there is a low risk of misuse of data.
The period from which we collected the clinical data was before the prevention was in full implementation.
It have been previously reported that the N7-guanine-MTase domain is not uniformly present in nsp14-containing nidoviruses [21] .
Interestingly, while we found a few MHC Class II epitopes using our approach (Table S3) , only one of these (HLA-DRB1*01:01) appeared in our identified epitope set (Table 3) , due to their comparatively low estimated population coverage.
The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
Once folded, the two domains form an 207 elongated structure, made of small beta strands which correspond on the HCA plot to small clusters.
Using this method, maximum cell counts were, respectively, 103712, 82308, and 92233 for Vero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 cell lines, reflecting innate variation in cell sizes.
Therefore, increasing did not improve the cluster 273 size distribution, as many importations in the reference clusters were not identified and the number of 274 mismatches increased (Supplement Figures S7) .
The present study specifically analyzed cases by (i) prefecture, (ii) age, and (iii) 16 severity.
In this study, we elaborate the SEIR model to 73 include a compartment( ) with higher transmission rates.
Of the latter cases, some have water, unlike the VSD amino acid triad that can transmit a proton without water.
The IFIT3 model lacks a positively-charged nucleic acid binding surface like that of IFIT2.
All mice were similarly close to the odor port at the onset of CS+ odor presentation (Mann-Whitney test, U=28, p=0.7209, Figure 2D ), and had similar maximum velocities during the 7 s time period that preceded odor presentation (Mann-Whitney test, U=24, p=0.4418, Figure 2G ).

If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to take place in a US city, even with strong social distancing and contact tracing protocols as strict as the Wuhan lockdown, hospitalization and ICU needs from COVID-19 patients alone may exceed current capacity.
We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY's population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks.
The N-BAR-expressing cell shows a greater number of tubules that also persist longer compared to Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD.
By categorizing COVID-19 as a notifiable disease Class B, Chinese Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases required all cases to be immediately reported to China's Infectious Disease Information System.
After 50 days since the outbreak, the cumulative cases can reach rapidly above 40 cases for many cities.
To better resolve the location of 2 R , we treated Saos-2 cells with the small molecule YM201636, an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide kinase PIK-fyve that enlarges Rab7 + endolysosomes (78, 79).

On performing MSA, shown in figure 7D, we found that ORF 3a protein of SARS-COV-2 is found to be closer to ORF3a of Bat CoV (73.36%) than ORF3a of Human SARS (72.99%).
Based on the above assumption and previous studies, we 110 modeled the epidemic information of virus as logistic form (Eq.
"Exposed" refers to the stage when a person becomes infected by a disease vector, but has not reached the stage where it can infect another person; "Infectious" refers to the stage when the person is a potential disease vector; "Isolated" refers to the stage where the person loses the ability to be a disease vector (i.e.
Excluding GAPDH due to its stability.

A key area of uncertainty is if and for how long individuals are infectious before symptom onset, and if asymptomatic or subclinical infection occurs.
All patients were treated in isolation.
Most of previous work use simple exponential growth models and focus on the early growing process [1] [2] [3] [4] .
In order to understand the features of COVID-19 in Xiangyang, we conducted a cross-sectional study to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Xiangyang No.1 people's hospital.
However, primers with no flap showed some discrepancy among the replicates at the lowest concentration (10 fg; DICg F1/R1).
The highest accuracy was observed with the combination of the CNN+LSTM architecture and the online input preparation.
Firstly, some patients did not receive timely supportive interventions such as admission to ICU, because increasing number of severe patients occurred in a short period.
These drawbacks prompted the development of algorithms, referred to as hybrid methods (19) (20) (21) (22) , that take advantage of SR depth and accuracy to compensate LR shortcomings.
are confronted with an ongoing epidemic outbreak.
This framework provides a more 121 generalized expression to estimate the cumulative imported cases (first wave of transmission) and the 122 cumulative secondary infected cases generated by the imported cases (second wave of transmission) at 123 connected cities or locations during a certain period of time when the incidence is exponentially increasing at 124 the source.

, the number of quarantined infected individuals.
From and evolutionary perspective, it was recently suggested that the nido-like clade of animal viruses emerged in early invertebrates and through horizontal virus transmission then colonized vertebrates.
All patients were seroconverted, except for 12 patients with only samples collected at the early stage of illness (before 13 day of onset).
Susceptible individuals get infected by contact with infectious individuals with the rate proportional to the contact rate, r C .
