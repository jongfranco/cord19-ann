In the present study, we aimed to examine whether and when the COVID-19 cases during their incubation period infect others, in order to offer clues to containment measures to mitigate the spread of infection.
As for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups, they show significant differences across age groups.
To predict the final number of cases outside Hubei, we assume a gradually increasing control u from zero until a saturation point, and define t * the time when the eventual control u max is achieved.

We show that lineage B RBDs divide into functionally distinct clades and that several previously-unappreciated viruses exhibit compatibility with an unknown receptor on human cells.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
The reason for this difference is that the oxygen atom of the thiohemiketal accepts a hydrogen bond from the catalytic His40 in the CVB3 protease, rather than from the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole as in the SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 enzymes (Fig.
On the level of individual genes, social history effects were detectable in all three conditions, but were by far more apparent in the unstimulated, control condition than in the LPS or Gard conditions (Fig.

Different control measures affect different key parameters.
Furthermore, as both ZIKV genomic material and viral particles are detected in placental cells until the end of pregnancy (regardless of the trimester in which infection occurred), it is plausible to speculate that the infection of the fetus could happen as a secondary event, i.e., not necessarily concomitant with the maternal acute phase of disease (Aagaard et al., 2017) .
Due to the lack of data, there might exist significant errors in the simulated results.
