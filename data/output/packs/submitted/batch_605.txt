Our estimates of R are smaller than the ones reported by Tindale et al.
Firstly, due to the limitations of the retrospective study, laboratory examinations were performed according tothe clinical care needs of the patient, thus some patients' laboratory exam results were incomlpeted.
Therefore, as p early gets smaller, we expect stronger intervention to be required in order to control the disease.
Although not formally timed, we estimate that using this approach coupled to MinION based sequencing, then genomic information can be obtained within ten hours.
At these input amounts, both technical replicates, with and without capture and in both 30 ng and 300 ng of background, yielded at least 2 million sequencing reads.
