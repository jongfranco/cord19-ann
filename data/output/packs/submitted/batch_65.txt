Since our detection signal is proportional to the number of looped nanoswitches, a nanoswitch mixture for different target sequences within the viral genome is expected to provide an increased signal.
If L-DOPA promotes parkin loss at least in part by increasing its turnover, then we would expect to see loss of overexpressed exogenous parkin.
