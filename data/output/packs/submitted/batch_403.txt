Each viral primer/probe set was multiplexed with primer/probe set for human RPP30 gene to control the sample collection, as the amount of biological material varies from sample to sample, and with a primer/probe set for an artificial RNA sequence (artificial external control -AEC), which is introduced during extraction, to control the RT-qPCR steps and its inhibition.
They were then back-diluted 1:100 and grown in 0.5% xylose until the cells reached mid-log phase.
We focus on the effect of population flows from the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak, because data on real time travel between cities have recently become available and we examine whether it can explain the disease spread, and that Wuhan is a major city and a transportation hub with significant population movements.

In comparisons of seroconversion rates of antibodies between critical and non-critical patients, none of the three markers showed significant difference ( Figure 1B , 1C and ID, p > 0.05).
To simplify our calculations, we introduce a mapping c : V → C that maps any molecular formula to the compound it belongs to: c(v) = c for all v ∈ V (c), for c ∈ C. Note that c(a(c)) = c for all c ∈ C. Now, unfortunately, we will see that this is not easy, as the underlying computational problem is NPcomplete.

Our sample starts from January 19, when the first COVID-19 case was reported outside Wuhan.
As repeat regions of a virus usually cover less than 10% of the genome [19] , if any virus is covered for more than 10% by the reads, it is reasonable to assume that the reads are not merely from repeat regions and thus the virus should be considered in the annotation result.
To confirm the value of BAHcrit experimentally, we first used the nine experimental 15 conditions previously tested (A1-3, B1-3, C1-3) to fit the values for kcat and r (Fig S2) , and then used the computationally-derived critical BAH threshold to classify the phenotype of nine bacteriaprodrug treatment conditions.
