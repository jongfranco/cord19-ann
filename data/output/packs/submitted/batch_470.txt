For example, methods based on chromosome conformation capture, such as Hi-C, can identify and confirm global chromosomal interactions, while methods based on luciferase assays, such as self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) or other massively parallel reporter assays, can validate the regulatory activity of identified enhancers.

We observed that, in the presence of RNase HI, sensitive bacteria initially outcompete resistant clones but, as the propagation progresses, resistant bacteria increase in frequency -likely due to compensatory evolution -finally reaching coexistence ( Figure 5A Figure 5B ).
Cells induced to mate were plated by limiting dilution to isolate diploid clones.

The analysis on a single season illustrates well how the epidemic impact of school closure depends on the interplay between closure timing and in-fluenza season.
The large majority of cases, in all situations considered, are contained within Hubei province.
Since many phylogenetic methods assume that the data (e.g., different genes) have evolved over the same tree, and that the chosen data partitions have evolved independently under the same time-reversible Markovian conditions, it is wise to survey the sub-MSA for evidence that the sequences actually have evolved under these conditions.

Further in vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies in rats and monkeys showed that CVL218 was highly distributed in the lung tissue and no apparent sign of toxicity was observed, which makes it an appealing potential drug candidate for the treatment of the novel pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In practice, for regularization parameter estimation, Equation 6 is solved on a discretized parameter space where a relatively simple discrete search method can be used (e.g., as opposed to continuous gradient-based optimization).
The constraint N on the number of probes in the union is specified by the user; this is the number of probes to synthesize, and might be determined based on synthesis cost and/or array size.

In the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, there may be cases of underreporting or concealment in Wuhan, which may make it difficult to objectively reflect the true epidemic characteristics of COVID-19.
Our data cannot point towards any one of these explanations, although we note that the high-copy number proteins of ΦX174 tend to have higher CAI values and are more easily deoptimized.
