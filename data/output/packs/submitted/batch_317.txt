We reasoned that the classification features of a particular phenotype would be broadly related to its functional properties and that when they are subjected to an independent unsupervised enrichment analysis, they would successfully predict the phenotypes from which they were initially derived.
Therefore, for the further study, we selected only those PGQs that satisfying the aforesaid criteria of G-quadruplex formation and were listed in Table 1 .
Examples of particular host factors that bind to viral surfaces have previously been described.

1 Early on during the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers (HCW) were found to beat high risk of developing COVID-19, even when infection prevention measures were in place, including usage of personal protective equipment (PPE: eye protection/face shield, respiratory protection, isolation gowns, and gloves), hand hygiene, and patient placement in negative-pressure isolation rooms.
Nevertheless, we provide a straightforward methodology for translating estimates of transmission heterogeneity into epidemic forecasts.
(A) Design of the control experiment.
There are other important phenomena not covered by our simple framework.
Ontology analysis indicated that proteins involved in vesicle 142 transport and fatty acid metabolism were significantly enriched ( Fig S2 and Table  143 S3), fitting with previous observations that the viral replication complex is associated 144 with cytoplasmic membranous structures (Cotton et al., 2017; Hyde and Mackenzie, 145 2010; Hyde et al., 2009) .

The fit parameter specifies the average elongation rate.
Specifically, a T7 promoter and anti-terminator STAR sequence were added to the 5' end of a reverse RPA primer, which when combined with a forward primer, amplified a 40 nt viral sequence to produce a double-stranded DNA encoding the designed STAR which contained the target viral .
Hierarchical models are particularly adapted to this task, as they naturally pool information among several past epidemics and capture both within-and between-location variability [43] .

We observed a decrease in MBP in the BE-prone B6NJ substrain versus BE-resistant B6J 368 substrain that was significant for the14 kDa isoform (Fig.5) and was consistent with our previous 369 observation of an association of BE with the downregulated expression of a set of genes enriched 370 for myelination (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) .
SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 protein as their receptors [4] , which explains its similarly high transmissibility.
In combination with the epitopes, this arrangement has several advantages: 1) epitope densities are maximal since -1 frame epitopes act as linkers for the 0 frame and vice versa; 2) signals are digital, so frameshifted and non-frameshifted species are marked by two distinct probes/colors, and 3) epitopes are placed in nearly equivalent positions, so signals appear at roughly the same time and with similar amplification when translated with similar kinetics.
Saprospiraceae are frequently observed in wastewater treatment systems 30, 32 , where they likely play a role in heterotrophic polymeric degradation 24, 25 .

After a saturating dose of apical 2FLI, another increase in apical 2FLI did not elicit a further response, while application of basolateral 2FLI did (Fig 3A, left) .
From Table 3 , we see that the logistic regression model has a high coefficient of determination of 0.996, while the pvalue (< 0.000) indicates that all the regression parameters are statistically significant.
The sites that bear signatures of this coevolution tend to be functionally important, 219 and so identifying them can lend insight into how a given receptor functions.
A second thread is that a "grass is greener syndrome" (i.e., movement 357 decisions are based purely on resource considerations) leads to increased stress in
social distancing and epicenter lockdown, to models.
10.20033944 doi: medRxiv preprint mutation sites, NO.20 was caused by a sequencing error while NO.14 and No.
We selected the clade 2 spike, As6526, because it consistently gave strong entry signal in human cells following protease-treatment (figure 2b) as well as BM48-31, the only clade 3 spike in our panel.
This position is a selfstabilizing dynamic equilibrium point (intersection of red and green curves) without sliding direction bias here, but with biases towards this point from neighboring positions.
However, since there were changes in C2:C3 proportion in BEO group, the 457 increase of propionic acid could consequently impact on glucose blood concentration.

After mixing, cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 300 x g to initiate interaction of the cells.
All other cases are assumed to have been infected locally.
Viral isolation from field samples is rarely successful and reverse genetics recovery of recombinant virus is labor-intensive, and expensive as synthesis of a single genome can cost upwards of $15,000.
For these critical patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy also should be supported early to ameliorate the symptom of refractory hypoxia.
We were not surprised to find such high rates of mapping for mature miRNAs, however, a 10% mapping rate for pre-miRNAs is significantly higher than previous attempts to sequence pre-miRNAs without pre-miRNA specific primers (0.8%) (27) .
Lastly, based on V D3 is a natural agonist of VDR and there are a very high affinity between them (Haussler, Jurutka, Mizwicki & Norman, 2011) , the effect of AS on TNF-α level was investigated in presence and in absence of V D3 to validate the above findings.
