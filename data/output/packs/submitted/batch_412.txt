It is unclear in the literature to what extent depression is a secondary reaction to living with HIV or is a neurologic symptom of the predominantly frontalsubcortical clinical profile of the disease.
Delays between key epidemiological timings (e.g., infection, symptom onset, and detection) can also shift the shape of an observed epidemic curve and, therefore, affect parameter estimates as well as predictions of the course of an outbreak (Tariq et al., 2019) .
Other potential 72 targets included Lrrc33, Sec22a, Parp14, and Ildr1; however, these genes either have little 73 known linkage to viral replication and the immune response (e.g., Lrrc33, Sec22a, and Ildr1) or 74 the directionality of the correlation did not support their relationship to viral titer in the lung 75 (Parp14).

Our bioinformatic protein structural analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a (cluster 12), also known as viroporin, and ORF7a (cluster 17), that is same as ORF8a 14 in SARS, retain the structural features observed in other SARS viruses, namely a multi-pass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic b-barrel or b-sandwich fold (ORF3a) and an N-terminal secpathway signal peptide, cleaved after residue 15, an immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich fold stabilized by two cysteine di-sulfide bonds, and a C-terminal single-pass transmembrane helix (ORF7a; Supplementary Figures 5,6 ).
In this case, we hypothesized that the overlap in the lists of DEGs must be similar for WT and viruses of equivalent fitness (e.g., PC48 or PC55), whereas the magnitude of the overlap between DEG lists would decrease as differences in fitness exist.
