For instance, the total amount of 299 exons in the JGI annotation of T. adherens (Triad1) was only 14Mb, over twofold lower than the related 300 species, the placozoan H. hongkongensis, and thus it was expected to contain many more or longer genes 301 than were present in the original Triad1 annotation.
These patients experienced mild to moderately severe illness.
The sequences are then aligned, the aim being to obtain an MSA, wherein homologous characters (i.e., nucleotides or amino acids) are identified and aligned.
Our findings suggest that instances of human infection with MERS-CoV are more common than currently thought, with exceedingly short transmission chains mostly limited to primary cases that might be mild and ultimately not detected by surveillance or sequencing.
If there is no bias for sliding in either direction, the nucleosome will experience a random walk along the DNA (regions C in in three hypothetical examples Figure  7A ).

Notably, IGKV2D-29*02, previously referred to as "VA2c", has a non-canonical V-heptamer, but has also been shown to occur in productive rearrangements; thus, like IGKV1-8 and IGKV1D-13 alleles described in CH17, the expression of IGKV2D-29*02 could be explained by a previously undescribed regulatory sequence variant.
