We will assume that two factors play a central role in determining the relative attractivity of each subpopulation: a characteristic size parameter N c i and the ratio of infectious individuals I i (t)/N i (t) for the i th population, i = 1, ..., m. For example, we might assume attractivity falls off linearly from 1 to 0 with the ratio I i /N i (i.e., use the factor (1 − I i /N i )).
