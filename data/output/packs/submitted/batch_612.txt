Recent studies on episodic and contextual learning in hippocampal neural networks have suggested that memories are encoded in the activity of distributed ensembles of neurons, often referred to as a 'memory trace' (Mayford and Reijmers, 2015; Poo et al., 2016; Tonegawa et al., 2015) .
Besides aspect of macro level of spreading, we should pay attention to 33 some more details besides the general infection coverage so as to achieve fine 34 prediction.

Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread [41] .
The study was conducted in the main RFTB colony known to date on Reunion island, a natural cave (30 m 3 ) in the West coast of the island (21,111°S, 55,259°E).
