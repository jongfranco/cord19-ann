Similarly, out-of-order links (e.g., 263 between a bat and a rodent) scaled linearly with the product of the species richness of both 264 orders ( Figure SI7 ).
The distributions largely accord with our expectations; for the distance and vertical phenotypes, the right tails of the RIX distributions are thicker than those for the other samples, consistent with their expected hybrid vigor.
In agreement with the binding data, structural superimposition of the peptide shows that while NTD (of NTDCCD structure) may delicately interfere with peptide binding at site-1 ( Figure 3A ), CTD (of CCDCTD structures) would provide a more robust interference at site-2 ( Figure 3B ).
