In the current model, the MAD2 O-C conversion is catalyzed by a 2:2 MAD1:C-MAD2 tetramer localized at unattached kinetochores, whereby cytoplasmic O-MAD2 hetero-dimerizes with the C-MAD2 moiety in the catalyst and morphs into C-MAD2 through unknown mechanism but possibly involving some intermediate folding states (I-MAD2) (6, 7, 10) .
