This hypothesis is corroborated by the observation that viral proteins are able to bind directly vitamin D 3 (16) , and fatty acids show anti-viral properties that are due to prevention of entry of the viral genome into the host cell (17) as we propose being the case for the interaction between DBP-MAF/vitamin D 3 /fatty acids and preS1 and L protein hydrophobic sequences.
