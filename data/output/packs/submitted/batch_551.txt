In general, the rate of R6G efflux was higher in the presence, than 217 in the absence, of FLC, with SC5314 as the notable exception ( Fig.
Since the rate of progression changes over time and the exponential model does not hold any longer, we considered mainly the initial days of the time series, selecting several periods of time composed each one of a predetermined number of consecutive days, but with different starting points.

It is important to note that while the presented method is designed to use prior knowledge of viral infection timing patterns, uniform probability distributions were used since an accurate estimate of the distribution is not likely in the general case.
Typically we have to wait until the curve has moved closer to the desirable orbits before implementing the intervention.
While on the one hand, this geographical proximity guarantees high rates of mutual intergenerational solidarity, both financial and in-kind, one obvious consequence is that Italians often prefer not to move for work but to live close to their family and commute daily to go to work.
8h 196 following HD5EU administration 5EU was still detectable in long RNA (though it could not be 197 accurately quantified as it was below quantification limit), whilst only a moderate reduction was 198 detected in short RNA.

Note that this latter assumption is especially poor when the number of infected individuals (predominately controlled by k and/or treatment) is low since a limited number of individuals asserting their influence on the reservoir will lead to stronger cross-
