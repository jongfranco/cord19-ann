Because of the critical role played by the S glycoprotein in virus entry, 116 pathogenesis, and tropism, and since the S proteins of serotype I and II strains differ greatly, we propose 117 a classification of Alphacoronavirus 1 strains into two clades (Alphacoronavirus 1 clade A and B), using a 118 functionally-based S protein sequence classification that reflects the previously determined serologically-119 based demarcation.
