This transition marks the point at which the STH transmission is sustained endemically, and hence the UES migration rate that this corresponds to is of critical importance to policy makers and implementers of STH control programmes since achieving elimination above this critical point in migration rate is likely impossible without treating the external source of migrants simultaneously.
