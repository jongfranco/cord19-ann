To identify proteins that were enriched in the cilia of S. rosetta, we compared the unique 784 peptide count of two cilia samples ( Figure 1G, fractions 4 and 5) to the cell body sample 785 (fraction 1) and the microvilli sample (fraction 10) and discounted proteins that did not have a 786 unique peptide count in either fraction 4 or 5 that was greater than fraction 1 and 10.
In the case of the ORF1a and ORF1b genes, a large proportion of the genomic RNA is expected to be destined for packaging rather than translation, as mentioned above, and this probably explains the low TE values calculated for these genes ( Fig.
At individual level and for the three species considered, the complete models were used 169 since no model was selected by AIC (∆AIC < 3).
Afterwards, the supernatant was separated chromatographically by size-exclusion chromatography (ÄKTA purifier system, GE Healthcare, equipped with a XK50/100 column packed with Sepharose 6FF), and the fractions containing the mucin glycoproteins were identified via PAS (periodic acid/Schiff's base) staining and pooled.
