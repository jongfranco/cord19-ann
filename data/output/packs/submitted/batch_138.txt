We tested for "orderly" extinctions in which extinction preferentially happens from the viruses to which hosts have most immunity to those that can infect many hosts.
Although positivity in fetal endothelium and maternal leukocytes (Ritter et al., 2017) , and in decidual cells, CTBs and mesenchymal cells of chorionic villi (Rabelo et al., 2018) in a few first trimester placentas has also been reported, we speculate that maternal or other fetal cells may be infected only transiently.
