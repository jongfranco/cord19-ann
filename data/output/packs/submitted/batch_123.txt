This observation indicates that the GQDs are not toxic to the individual bacteria cells per se, and thus the biofilm dispersal is associated with change in ECM integrity only.
On the other hand, a low RCDI is indicative that some viral genes are expressed in latency phases or even that the virus might present a low replication rate for successful establishment in a host with alternative codon usage patterns (Puigbo et al., 2010) .
We 233 estimated the potential total numbers (refer to Table 1) under the assumption that the relative 234 uncertainty of the reported data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and 235 a standard deviation of 10%, and this deviation may be underestimated.
