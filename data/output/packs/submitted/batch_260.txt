Network clusters/sub-networks were extracted using the Cytoscape plugin MCODE (version 1.5.1, Bader and Hogue 2003) .
Because all five modeling methods use different assumptions and tools and are likely to produce widely varying estimates of the basic reproduction number based on different aspects of the epidemic process, we combined all five estimates to produce an overall value for the basic reproduction number.
Notice that by doing that we underestimate the probability of an excursion to reach any threshold we may explain why we overestimate the spillover transmission τ maximizing the number of outbreaks.

11b , Germany had same COVID-19 trend as all others except Iran, which is not a bad news for Germans, but better ones comes when we want to calculate CFR.
Whether this property is negligible or not in our 'exclusive' supramolecular forms has not been tested: rearrangement of each molecule in this architecture or exchange with similar but unrelated molecules [88] would be necessary to inhibit this photosynthetic light reaction completely and surround the prototype scA2AR/D2R.
Indeed, it is known from our previous study that Guarani impaired the infectivity of its viral host APMV, resulting in a decrease in amoebae lysis 24 .

A particularly important point to raise is that for an infection like COVID-19 with a relatively high proportion of severe cases, we need to think carefully about an intervention before we decide that it is not sustainable.

This strongly suggests that individual bat species harbor specific CoV lineages, but 253 CoV transmission between different bat species may nevertheless occur infrequently.
41 It would also be of interest to further study the 350 stability of these identified phenotypes to learn if subjects experience the same type of 351 author/funder.
The flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) activates ribonuclease L (RNase L) catalytic antiviral 26 function during infection, yet deletion of RNase L decreases ZIKV production, suggesting 27 a proviral role of RNase L. In this study, we reveal that latent RNase L supports ZIKV 28 replication factory (RF) assembly.

These appear to have significantly reduced transmission, apparently reducing the effective reproduction number (the number of new infections per infected individual) very close or below one [6, 10] , although there is still a lot of uncertainty about the effectiveness of control measures [5] .
In contrast, diabetes was not significantly associated with ICU admission, although the Tau-squared value here was unusually high implying a high level of heterogeneity between studies in this particular case.
