This result suggests that mutations in the Y and LL motifs of OuMV MP have also an effect in virus replication.
For the data-driven parameters, these uncertainties are likelihoods, which can be interpreted as posteriors if one's prior is an improper uniform distribution; we fit lognormal distributions to the 95% CIs and central estimates in order to obtain the full distribution.

Given the median incubation period of 4-6 days for COVID-19 [11] , the overall COVID-19 incidence in provinces with lags of 2-3 weeks, or approximately 2-3 times the median incubation period, could be reflective of the second-or third-generation transmissions.
