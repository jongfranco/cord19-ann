In addition, it is known that D 2 O makes a difference to gating, slowing it down, at least in Na + channels (143) (144) (145) ; it is reasonable to assume that in this respect Na + and K + channels are similar.

This is visually clear in figure 4b , where the fully recoded gene H (3 recoded fragments) has far lower fitness than one would expect based on the individually recoded fragments-all of which were basically neutral.
