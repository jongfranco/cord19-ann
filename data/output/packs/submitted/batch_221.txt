Syncytial knots are specializations in the syncytiotrophoblast, and an increase in these structures in late gestation indicates placental pathology and can be used to evaluate villous maturity.
Interestingly, low somatic expression of DUX4-fl mRNA per se is not necessarily pathogenic since expression can be detected in some rare cultures of myogenic cells and muscle biopsies from healthy and asymptomatic FSHD subjects, albeit at levels significantly lower than in equivalent cells and tissues from FSHD-affected subjects [9, 16, 17] .
The genome of each virophage was assembled and analyzed as previously described by Mougari et al 24 .
Therefore, cDNA sequencing approaches that retain the full-length poly(A) tail would enable studies where material is scarce as well as increase statistical power of poly(A) tail estimates.

In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress regionally and globally, we would expect a rise in respiratory mortality concentrated among ages 30 and above.
In order to satisfy the 'Diminishing Adaptation' condition (40), which is necessary to ensure the Markov chain is ergodic and converges to the correct posterior distribution, it is required that c k tends to a constant as k ae OE.
