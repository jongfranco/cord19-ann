We therefore tested for differences in relative abundance in autumn-winter and spring-summer, adjusting for age and number of prior infections; this confirmed significant seasonal effects on the abundance of Haemophilus (summer associated) and Moraxella (winter associated) amongst ARI samples, and a similar but non-significant trend amongst healthy NP samples (Fig.
We show here, for the first time, that patients with COPD who have a history of frequent exacerbations have reduced airway anti-microbial immunity when assessed at clinical stability and during subsequent virus-associated exacerbation with an associated increase in bacterial loads.
