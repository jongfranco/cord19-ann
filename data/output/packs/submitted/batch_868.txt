Both the IL-6 and GADD45B SREs were mapped to their 3'UTR 55
Another advantage of our method is that we can derive a proper variance estimate for the generation interval, in contrast to using a too large variance estimate that is obtained when using the serial interval as a proxy for the generation interval.
To obtain an initial assessment of shared and/or specific features of the 2019-nCoV spike (S) envelope glycoprotein, a protein sequence alignment was performed to compare the sequence of the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain of the novel coronavirus with that of the closely related human SARS-CoV S strain Tor2 sequence ( Supplementary Fig.

3 -figure supplement 1A) and rescuing a tagged variant of the virus (NAΔCT).
Extensive empirical analysis and inspection of the annotation results show that for very small viruses, only a few reads are enough to cover a good portion of the viral genome, resulting in high R and C o that pass criteria 1 and 2.
Five sampled locations are highlighted in different colours.
Due to these designed overlaps, as well as the presence of homologous peptides from related viruses, a wide range of epitope redundancy exists within the library.
