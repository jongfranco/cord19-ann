Estimating generation intervals is complex; our goal with pseudo-realistic distributions is not to precisely match real diseases, but to generate distributions that are likely to be roughly as challenging for our approximation methods as real distributions would be.
This may be since Tibetan students were from more remote and isolated areas, they were more susceptible in their new environment.
These polices are also responsible for the limited observed heterogeneity in uptake and changes of precautionary behaviors.
This 229 suggests that while the rest of the Archaea community is relatively stable, the strictly rare biosphere 230 is dynamic and depends on the proper conditions to prosper.

Therefore, differential transcription analysis of genes was performed using DESeq2.
Continuous variables were described as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR).
Importantly, because LD-based studies require recessive mutations to be on the same genetic background and total variant burden analyses are not allele-specific, neither discerns between dominant and recessive models of inheritance.
A threat to the accuracy of these projections is if a substantial proportion of infection has been due to multiple exposures to animals that has been curtailed in some way.
