Our model now adds that sliding from neighboring positions will always (within ruler reach) convene at the cognate site and stabilize this position, even if there is no local sliding rate minimum, as long as the ruler regulates sliding direction bias according to the three key elements outlined above ( Figure 7C, left) In vivo there are many ways that may regulate nucleosome positioning by remodelers, e.g., by recruitment, by architectural factors, by nucleosome density fluctuations or by histone variants and modifications, possibly in the context of elongating polymerases.

The transmission rate β(t) is related to the basic reproduction number by the formula (11) Cross immunity of HCoV-OC43 against HCoV-HKU1 was captured by χ1,2 such that the transmission rate of HCoV-HKU1 to an individual who is exposed to, infected with, or recovered from HCoV-OC43 was reduced by a factor of 1-χ1,2, and vice-versa.
Besides, the direct impact is also small: for example, if temperature raises 20ºC, it is expected that in the best-case scenario the doubling time increases on average 1.8 days.
