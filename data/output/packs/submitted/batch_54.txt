A single-cell neighborhood graph was computed on the 50 first principal components that sufficiently explain the variation in the data using 15 nearest neighbors.
We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical predictors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias toward transition replacements observed in evolutionary studies.
Theorem 5 When R 0 = 1 and c > 1−σ a , then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium E 4 (x 4 , y 4 ), and the equilibrium E 4 is stable if ψ 4 < 0.

The peripheral α-helices show significant improvement in the level of detail resolved in the density map, allowing tracing of backbone and side-chains in the non-uniform refinement result.
We also assumed a very optimistic scenario of 80% of contacts being identified, which may not occur with high case numbers, if a high proportion of asymptomatic transmission is occurring, or if self-quarantine is ineffective.
For the phylogenetic analysis, we used RNA sequences from 18 GenBank entries of representatives of the JMTV group and the three ALSV strains isolated in the present study (Table 1 ).

ViromeScan generated alignment results and abundances of viruses at family, genus, and species level.
In addition to toll-like receptors (TLRs), whose signalling during phagocytosis rapidly recruits LC3 to phagosomes, the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4 or the C-type lectin Dectin-1 can also induce LAP to efficiently clear dead cells and to facilitate antigen presentation, respectively[29, 48, 49] .
48 hpt cells were lysed in TAP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 573 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1% NP-40; 2 mM TCEP; PIC) and the lysates were 574 centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min.

Based on our earlier observation that DNA nanoswitches can detect microRNAs (~22 nucleotides) at the sub-picomolar scale 27 without amplification, we wanted to assess the sensitivity of our approach for ZIKV RNA detection.
We then permuted these blocks across social group labels (n=9 blocks and labels: one set for each social group), while keeping the gene expression data associated with the original social group label.
Our deep learning-based drug repositioning models employ mathematical pose (MathPose) and mathematical deep learning (MathDL) to predict 3D poses and protein-ligand binding affinities.
