These data suggest that re-exposure of mice to the CS+ causes an increase in anxiety-like behavior, expressed as a decrease in exploratory behavior in the open field.
Part of the difficulty stems from the read length limitation of existing deep DNA sequencing technologies, an issue compounded by the extensive level of homology across viral and bacterial species.
From the fitted curve, we could have deduced the stability of Wenzhou even early at Feb 01, 2020.

If the value of R0 is as high in other countries, our results suggest that active and strong population-wide social distancing efforts, such as closing down transportation system, schools, discouraging travel, etc., might be needed to reduce the overall contacts to contain the spread of the virus.

Intriguingly, the mechanisms 409!
The genes expressed only in tissue (n = 141) are mostly involved in immune pathways e.g.
We have recently shown that plasminogen is an effective sterol acceptor through ABCA1 and this could be the mechanism by which plasminogen contributes to atherosclerosis (Pamir et al., 2017) .
Patients were divided into two strata according to the cutoff value of NLR (low risk: < 3.13; high risk: ≥ 3.13) and age (age < 50 years; age ≥ 50 years).

For ease of visualization, the mean fold increase 483 for each target is presented in Fig 6, although not statistically significantly, higher than in the mock and wt virus-infected mice (Fig 6A   490 and B).
This could be due to differences in the neuroimaging methodology used (e.g.

A number of studies have looked into the relationship between ACE2 expression level and coronavirus infection.
This can be explained by the fact that information on Wikipedia is rather static, and users will view Wikipedia pages immediately after the news breaks but they will not return in the next days, unless more recent events renew their attention 32 .
Two reports on the histological examination of the lungs of three patients showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), pulmonary oedema and hyaline membrane formation, indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as 30 characteristic syncytial cells in the alveolar lumen (6, 7) , similar to findings during the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS-CoV (8) .
Due to several challenges in discovery and development of NVIs, along with lack of therapeutic intervention and the pathogenic propensity of the virus, Nipah infections are enlisted amongst WHO's list of priority diseases [22] .
The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2).
