To normalize for library size, reads per million mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of positive-sense virus and host RefSeq mRNA reads as the denominator.
As such, they typically rely on assumptions that fit DNA-seq data properties and thus a linear reference genome.

As recently observed during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak in New York, 328 delays in childhood vaccination, local susceptibility, and increased contacts can lead to large outbreaks 329 following importations [52, 53] .
In addition, the widespread use of intravascular catheters and irrational use of broad spectrum antibiotic has led to the increasing incidence of multi-drug resistant organisms, serious opportunistic, and nosocomial infections, eventually may necessitate a prolonged therapy or experience disease relapses (32, 34, 62, (118) (119) (120) (121) (122) .

First, rat parkin cDNA was amplified from a previously generated parkin construct (described in [14] ) using primers to attach HA-and FLAG-tags on the N-terminus.
The distribution shows double peaks at the cluster positions because reads corresponding to mRNAs often miss the leader sequence, possibly due to basecalling or mapping errors.
In nasal swabs, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA peaked by day 2 p.i.
Results demonstrate that the model can successfully simulate the dynamic infecting process of COVID-19, and uncontrollable risks in a city can be predicted before they come true.
