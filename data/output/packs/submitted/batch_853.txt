Next, lesions in each lung lobe were labeled semi-automatically using serval seeds placed within lesion region to generate the contours.
The framework of the regression is based on the exponential form of the predictor to model the expectation of transmissibility (e.g., R); this framework is inspired by previous work [28] [29] [30] [31] .
The second problem was solved by regarding the COVID-19 detection problem as a weakly-supervised learning problem [24] , i.e., detecting COVID-19 without annotating the regions of COVID-19 lesions.
/2020 In addition, we observed a marked reduction in T and T H subtype cells in infected patients, suggesting that SARS-Cov-2 infection may impair cellular immunity.

The reservoir fluctuation model described above demonstrates how ageing can can only affect the system by a significant variation in k j between bins -furthermore, such fluctuations are can be shown to be damped significantly when the age bins are much wider than 1/(µ + µ 1 ) due to the relaxation timescale of each individual Poisson walker (see, e.g., Eq.

However, the definitive source of the virus is unknown.
Although the framework accounts for superspreading (by allowing overdispersion in the offspring distribution), we did not explicitly model superspreading events in the context of unsafe burial practices that lead to large-scale funeral exposures (30, 38) .
