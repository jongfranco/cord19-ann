This prediction can be used in conjunction with single-molecule experiments allowing for direct measurement of a key quantity in ion-RNA interactions; and (3) To the extent the downstream PK is a roadblock for translation, our work suggests that the ribosome should exert a force ∼ (10 − 15) pN [36] for unimpeded translocation along mRNA, although the actual force value could vary depending on factors such as interaction between PK and ribosome.
including SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers enrolled in the original cohort (n=26) and 172 an additional group of SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers who were enrolled in 2015 173 (n=20), and group 2 (n=40) of non-infected healthcare worker, selected as the control.
Note that on February 12, confirmed cases in Hubei included those confirmed by both laboratory and clinical diagnosis, leading to a one-time hump of the accumulated number.
