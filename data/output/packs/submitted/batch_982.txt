Alternatively, one can express θ in a low-dimensional basis (e.g., radial basis functions), but this requires prior knowledge of the expected degree of smoothness.
In the case of Apoa2, our previous studies indicated that structural variation affecting translation efficiency was largely responsible for the differences in protein levels among several common inbred strains (Bennett et al., 2010) .
To ensure that the RBP fusions are functional in vivo, we checked their localization patterns at different stages of oogenesis.

Since the 152 RBD function is essential for the virus, we hypothesize that the mutation-prone RBD should be 153 selected to maintain or even improve the binding affinity against human ACE2.
Since the functional cleft of MHC-I molecules is closed and can only accommodate short peptides ranging from 9 to 11 amino acids; all epitopes lengths were set to the optimum length of 9mers (150, 151) .As the predicted output is given in units of IC50 nM, absolute binding affinity threshold correlates better with immunogenicity (152) .
Similarly, N = number of enriched hitsshared virusi,j hits.
To do so, we drew 1 mL of whole blood from each female into each of three TruCulture blood collection tubes (Myriad RBM) containing either: (i) cell culture media only (negative control: "NC"); (ii) cell culture media plus 1 µg/mL of E. coliderived lipopolysaccharide (0111:B4 strain: "LPS" condition); or (iii) cell culture media plus 1 µg/ml of the TLR7 agonist Gardiquimod ("Gard" condition), a synthetic ligand that mimics infection with a single-stranded RNA virus.
