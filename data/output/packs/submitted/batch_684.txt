To assess the potential for unintended selection bias in our graph disconnection approach (such as inadvertantly favoring lower alignment scores or weaker enrichments), we performed two Mann-Whitney U tests to detect significant differences in z-scores or HSV1 alignment scores between the set of selected non-overlapping peptides versus the set of peptides discarded during network disconnection.

We also derived the basic reproduction number by assuming a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovery (SEIR) model for COVID-19, in which the incubation period is exponentially distributed with mean L in the range of 3 -6 days and the infectious period is also exponentially distributed with mean Z in the range of 2 to 7 days.
