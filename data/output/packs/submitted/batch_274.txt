OTU Delineation: Both alignment techniques resulted in two similar, clearly differentiated potential cutoff ranges, as demonstrated by consistent peaks in the histograms (Figure 1 ).
If that is true, a previous analysis that showed alternative splicing to be essential for Plasmodium stage differentiation [11] may possibly be explained by a requirement for modulation of abundance for specific proteins, rather than generation of protein sequences.
