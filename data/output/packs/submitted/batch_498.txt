A corresponding serial interval for each case was then drawn from a skewed normal distribution with the mean parameter of the distribution set to the incubation period for that case, a standard deviation of 2, and a skew parameter chosen such that a set proportion of serial intervals were shorter than the incubation period (meaning that a set proportion of transmission happened before symptom onset) ( Figure 2 ).
Finally, we took advantage of historical dominance rank data from the same females to evaluate whether, and for what genes and pathways, immune gene regulation in adulthood is influenced by biological embedding-when social experience leads to systematic, stable biological changes with the potential to influence health (45, 46) .
