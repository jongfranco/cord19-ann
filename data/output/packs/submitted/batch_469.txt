Although not all such experiments lead to small apparent movement, the fact that some do suggests using care in interpreting all the results.
', and their answers were in the following order: 'Physician/ health-care worker' had the first and highest (360, 75.5%); 'Internet/social media' was second high (305, 63.9%); next record (290, 60.8%) was 'TV/radio/newspaper'; next (211, 44.2%) was 'Ministry of health pamphlets'; whilst, 'Seminars' and 'Others' were the last and least, with records of (95, 19 .9%) and (15, 3.1%), respectively.
The network approach also accounts for stochasticity explicitly: Even with R 0 > 1, there is a probability 1 − R(∞) that patient zero lies outside of the giant outbreak and therefore only leads to a small outbreak that does not invade the population.
