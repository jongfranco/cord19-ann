Significantly, it also abrogated L-DOPA-induced parkin loss, but by about half (L-DOPA: 61.1 ± 3.0% of untreated; L-DOPA + epoxomicin: 80.5 ± 3.3% of untreated, p = 0.001, N = 8), consistent with half of L-DOPA-induced parkin loss being phospho-Ub-dependent (Fig.

Because 160 the IκBα protein inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation, its expression serves as a 161 feedback inhibitor of NF-κB activity (20) .
This has led to turning the focus on the host for therapeutic intervention, where targeting the host factors has been proven to be useful for restricting viral infections (Zumla et al.
Since MERS-CoV was also able to cause significant pathogenicity in the human host it was inevitable that parallels would be drawn between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV at the time of MERS discovery in 2012.
In contrast, in cells 265 treated with BFA or GCA, even though the presence of NSP2 was detected, no signal of the 266 trimeric form of VP7 was observed ( Fig 7A) .
We calculated unstandardized fitness effect sizes as e β , where β are the regression coefficients 125 in "log-linear" models of the form m ∼ g + G + gG, M ∼ G, and ∆m ∼ G. In log-linear models, slopes are meaningfully comparable to intercepts because they measure the total effect of group genotype from zero to one.

To further assess the robustness of the estimated generation interval distribution, for each dataset, we fit the model to data from the largest cluster.
