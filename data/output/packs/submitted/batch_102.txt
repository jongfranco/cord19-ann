As detailed in Section Materials & Methods, we cannot rule out that the molecular formula corresponds to, say, the compound minus a water loss instead of the full compound.
There is no evidence that gating in the non-TRP channels is cooperative, and no direct evidence that pertains to TRP channels either.
While utilizing a similar modeling structure for case reporting delays as the benchmark model (9) , NobBS introduces a simple dependency between case counts over time; that is, changes in case counts between weeks are assumed to be related via a first-order random walk process on the logarithmic scale.

Each infectious individual infects susceptible individuals at a rate βS/N (≈ β when S ≈ N ) over an infectious period that lasts on average for a time 1/(γ + α + µ).
However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis.

Linear correlation is expected to be zero if genic and intergenic fractions "expand" indifferently after a certain size, which appears to be around 500Mb.
Within this framework we derive a novel refinement algorithm, called non-uniform refinement, that accounts for structural variability, while taking care to ensure that the algorithm retains favourable statistical properties for validation and that it does not introduce avenues for over-fitting during 3D reconstruction.
4 this result is to be expected, as domain growth lowers the agent steady-state density but is not effective at reducing spatial correlations.

This suggests that acute inhibition of the CCL2:CCR2 axis either impacts neutrophil recruitment directly (for example, brain infiltrating neutrophils express CCR2 and respond to CCL2) or via an indirect effect on monocyte-to-neutrophil communication (for example, infiltrating monocytes release neutrophilic chemokines) [28] .
