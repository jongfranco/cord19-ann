This is critical since COVID-19 infection can rapidly progress from hospital admission to ARDS in as few as 2 days, and COVID-19 infection can be fatal
As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced "cytokine storms" that was fatal
This delay reflects the potentially long time from infection to severe and critical conditions as many COVID-19 patients who eventually require ICU care present initially as having only mild symptoms, and even longer time to discharge or death, resulting in the accumulation of hospitalized cases long after the downturns in the community spread.
Consistent with this report, we here also found that the secretion of cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 was increased in COVID-19 patients
Based on our findings and assuming no drastic change in infection rates (e.g., schools and workplaces remain closed and intercity travel limited), we can conclude, with optimism, that the COVID-19 epidemic would end around April 2020.

It worth nothing that this study was conducted in the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic when most of Chinese HCWs had been facing the most severe situation, which is causing extreme psychological response
Isolation of cases and contact tracing has been implemented for COVID-19
Although both diseases can have similar GGO and septal thickening, rounded morphology, peripheral distribution and fibrous lesion were relatively specific in COVID-19
In our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients
We estimated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 infections to be 4.9 days, which was calculated based on a big sample size with valid data
Social distancing, including school closures, can limit COVID-19 cases
Preventing recognition or blocking the occurrence of inflammatory action, new drugs development on immune regulation, might be new breakthroughs in the control of COVID-19 pneumonia
RT-LAMP meets these requirements and therefore has large value for screening and testing for COVID-19 in potentially exposed populations
A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in China in late-December 2019
7 mNGS in field settings proved critical in development of countermeasures for the 2014-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, just as ongoing sequencing of COVID-19 cases from lesser developed areas of Southeast Asia will contribute to overall understanding of pathogen transmission, origin, and evolution
Our results show the incubation mean and median of COVID-19 are 5.84 and 5.0 days respectively and there is a statistical significance with the role of gender
X indicates the cases who did not included in this study population but have been confirmed as COVID-19 pneumonia or as virus-carrier
Whereas positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract has been described , these observations do not address principal differences between SARS and COVID-19 in terms of clinical pathology
Among these pathways, the interferon-MAPK signaling pathway was the major blood immune response for COVID-19 infection
Genetic analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the virus was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
Due to similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS and COVID-19, we hypothesize that in addition to improve the oxygenation of the severe cases, iNO gas retains potent antiviral activity against 2019-nCoV responsible for SARS-CoV-2
Therefore, we speculate that persisting decrease of lymphocytes may be an indicator of severe disease, rather than a criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19
According to all models, temperature increases the doubling time, which means that it delays the spread of COVID-19
Fever is less widespread amongst those infected with COVID-19 than those with SARS-CoV (99%) and MERS-CoV (98%)
Given the superspreading is unlikely to occur, we can be confident to control the COVID-19 outbreak by reducing the reproduction number to below unity
Furthermore, the disease course of COVID-19, the duration of viral existence, and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers remain unknown
The severe situation of COVID-19 is also causing HCWs' mental health problems such as stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms in China
COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors
New genes; ORF8 and ORF6; were found inserted in COVID-19 which were absent in HCov-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission
Our analyses showed that rapid diagnosis and isolation of infections based on COVID-19 disease alone cannot control outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, but that the addition of tracing and isolation of traced cases could in theory be successful
Some common systemic symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, fatigue, sputum and myalgia, were more prominent in the patients admitted before January 23, but they were more insidious in patients admitted later
The need for provision for fetal monitoring including serial ultrasound for women with COVID-19 will be challenging for maternity services
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of COVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia
Lymphopenia is an effective and reliable indicator of severity and hospitalization in COVID-19 patients
In our survey, we found that although 81.1% of the parents were paying attention to the COVID-19 epidemic and the situation of the CKD itself, only 4.32% planned to adjust the medication dosage based on their previous medical knowledge and experience
As mentioned in previous studies, the severity of lymphocytopenia might indicate the severity of COVID-19, under the assumption of SARS-CoV-2 viral could attack and destroy the lymphocyte targetedly
In a recent analysis, of the 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, only 2.1% were in pediatric patients (≤19 years of age)
Moverever, the levels of elevated ALT and AST are generally not high on admission in our study, indicating the COVID-19 -related liver injury is not serious at the initial stage of infection
Regarding to laboratory tests, consistent with most reports, peripheral lymphocytopenia is the most crucial and common feature for COVID-19 infection
The existing spread of COVID-19 is faster than SARS partially because it has more complicate spread dynamics
COVID-19 is apparently more contagious than SARS and, without protection, people can be easily infected by close contact
Interestingly, there were 24 (45%) COVID-19 patients with elevation in the levels of one or more myocardial enzymes and markers of myocardial damage whose features did not meet the strict definition of myocardial injury, with most of them having the common NCP type and experiencing quick recovery; however, 58.33% of these patients exhibited LV dysfunction on echo, and long-term outcomes should be observed via follow-up in a future study
We demonstrate here that COVID-19 patients have very high levels of serum IL-10 following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also displaying high levels of the PD-1 and Tim-3 exhaustion markers on their T cells, suggesting that IL-10 might be mechanistically responsible
By assuming these rates of early epidemic growth, we estimate that 130 cities in China have ≥50% chance of having a COVID-19 case imported from Wuhan in the 3 weeks preceding the quarantine
Over half (n=30, 56.6%) of the COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated cardiac marker levels
In addition to the diagnosis value of Ab test, our study revealed a strong positive correlation between clinical severity and antibody titer since 2-week after illness onset, for the first time in COVID-19 patients
In this study, the median age of 116 COVID-19-confirmed patients was 54 years (IQR, 38-69; range 20-95 years), of which 67 (57.8%) were male
None of our cases had severe respiratory illness requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, suggesting it will be rare that patients meeting the definition of a suspected case will require enhanced care, at least while COVID-19 itself remains rare in the UK
Similar to the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS, severity of COVID-19 disease is associated with increased age and/or a comorbidity, although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups
Implications of all the available evidence: COVID-19 is currently exhibiting sustained transmission in China
The pathological process of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is the inflammation reaction characterized by destruction of deep airway and alveolar
COVID-19 has currently spread to 85 countries and most national authorities have failed to keep it's rapid spread contained
We assumed that it might be related to bystander activation induced by hyper inflammation, or a delayed response to the infection in severe COVID-19
The epidemiological curves of COVID-19 in China showed the progression of illness in the outbreak over time from December 8, 2019 up to February 11, 2020, 11 when there were a total of 72314 confirmed cases as the geo-temporal spread of COVID- 19
Some AIPs were targeted by multiple drugs, such as the heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
These relatively small changes in the subunit structures translate into larger shifts in the hexamer
Nearly half of patients showed increased levels of LDH, while one-third of patients suffered liver injury and decreased levels of prealbumin
Previous studies have suggested that the 265 mobility reduction could not effectively lower the incidence rate while 50% transmissibility 266 reduction could easily prevent the epidemics from further spreading
However, only one pair was selected because they had the bond energy, less than 2.00 kcal/mol
Our observation of glycan and fatty acid ligands in S1-S2 interfaces suggests a role for these ligands in modulating these interfaces and we hypothesize that these glycan and fatty acid interactions serve to stabilize the viral spike
Previous studies 75 from our group have demonstrated that rhinovirus (RV) species C is the most frequent viral pathogen detected in children who present to the local emergency department (ED) with an 77 asthma exacerbation
Similar to what have been reported with nanoparticles, we found that RSV accelerated the kinetics of amyloid aggregation of a model amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP (NNFGAIL)
There is accumulating evidence on the existence of many asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases

Thus, the C-terminal domain of XP is involved in membrane permeabilization and harbours key features of a viroporin
However, the N-terminal regions of S proteins display noteworthy differences
In addition to EVC and EVC2, we identified two paralogs, EVC3.1 and EVC3.2 323 , in the choanoflagellate, sea anenome and sea urchin ciliomes
Particularly, the influenza data seems considerably more affected by the smaller look-back windows
SMM algorithm of MHC-1 binding, transporter of antigenic peptides (TAP) transport efficiency and proteasomal cleavage efficiency are also considered to determine the IC 50 values for processing prediction of epitopes by MHC-I molecules
The off-diagonal numbers are genes that have differential expression in two viruses 560 compared to mock and the third virus, but are not significantly different from each other
Although sample availability was not a limiting factor for these two specimens, both proved reluctant to spread over the holes of cryoEM grids
The killer virus is a satellite RNA of L-A and is totally dependent on 231 L-A proteins for replication
A short homopolymeric stretch of 5' adenosine nucleotides thus might destabilize eIF4E binding to the mRNA cap
Although the overall mechanism involved in improved sensitivity and efficiency due to the use of flap primers in TaqMan qPCR assays is still not completely clear, a study conducted by Vandenbussche and group suggests that tailed primers suppress the formation of PCR artifacts, determined by primers and dNTP type
The signal corresponding to ubiquitin was elevated in both wild type and TRIM25 KO cells
Construction of the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) showed that these proteins were tightly interactive among each other and we here exhibited the most significant PPI
